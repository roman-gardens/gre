In the Hambacher Forst region, which lies approximately 30-35 km. west of the former capital city [Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium (mod. Cologne)](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/108751), a number of modest *villae rusticae* have been excavated.

<!--## Sublocation-->

<!--
[AREA WITHIN LOCATION, LIKE “PALATINE HILL”](GEOREFERENCE LINK)
A sublocation is any area larger than an individual garden, but located within a location. I would always try to include a link to a controlled vocabulary here if possible. This ID may well be different from the Garden ID, e.g., Pompeii versus a Garden in one of the houses which has its own Pleiades ID.

### Garden Description

This *villa rustica* was situated west of [Cologne](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/108751) in the same region as [Hambach 59]({{<relref "./niederzier-hambach59.md">}}). It was built in the late 1st century A.D. and inhabited until the 4th century (Plan 1). The farm had a calculated overall area, including the cultivated land, of 50 hectares.  The farm compound itself was one hectare in size. The modest house (A on plan) stood just inside the western border of the complex. Elsewhere on the property were various stables, barns, a pond and several wells.  

To the east of the house was an area marked off by a narrow ditch (B on plan). This was probably a bedding trench for a protective hedge around a vegetable garden (G on plan). Palaeobotanical material, all of it carbonized, from deposits in wells and pits provide information on the field crops.  Considerable amounts of charred chaff in a well in the eastern part of the farmyard suggest that a threshing area for the grain grown on the farm may have been situated near the well. The botanical remains indicate that spelt wheat was the main crop, followed by barley. The farmyard has hedge borders, the planting trenches for which were excavated.  Within this area, fruit trees, oaks and alders as well as elderberry bushes possibly were planted.
