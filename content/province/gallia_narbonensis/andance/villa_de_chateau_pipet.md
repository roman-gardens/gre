### Villa Description

1.2 kilometers south of the village of Andance, at the place called Château-Pipet, in the little valley of the Cueil, structures belonging without doubt to a Roman villa were discovered.   As early as 1867, the abbot Chaillet noted the presence of ruins in this area.  A salvage excavation in 1964 partially exposed a long ornamental pool associated with these structures.  A rectangular garden [1] of 152 square meters formed a part of the villa.  On the east side, the garden was bounded by a an unusual wall formed by eight half silos, or, seen form outside the garden, semicircular niches. Perhaps these niches were hidden by a wall along their back side, outside the garden, for a little of such a wall remains at either end.  On the inside of the garden, in the middle of this wall were the beginnings of a larger apse (shown in dotted lines on the plan).  One can see in this structure a supporting wall with internal buttresses.  To the west and to the south, the space was bordered by a gallery [2] ; the shafts of its columns were discovered in the excavations.   
Between the garden and the gallery on the west was a rectangular pool with a semicircular apse extending into the garden in the middle.  This pool, about 24 meters long and 2.3 wide, was covered in *opus signinum*.  It was perhaps completed by two arms along the other galleries, thus forming a U.  On the south side were found the beginnings of five rooms, but it was not possible to excavate them.   In the northwest corner of the garden, a repair was found in the form of a wall running parallel to the pool but 50 centimeters east of the garden-side pool wall.  It has been interpreted as a waterproofing device: a fill of a layer of green clay was place there without doubt to stop infiltration of water [4].  

No date was proposed for the structure in the excavation reports.
