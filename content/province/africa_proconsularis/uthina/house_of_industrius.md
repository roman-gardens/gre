## Province
[Africa Proconsularis]({{<relref "..">}}) \
[Africa proconsularis (Pleiades)](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/991341)

### Province Description
The history of Roman Africa begins in 146 BC with the destruction of Carthage and the establishment of the province of Africa in the most fertile part of the Carthaginian Empire.  The new province covered about 5000 square miles (17,172 square kilometers) of the northern part of modern Tunisia.  A *praetor* governed the area from his headquarters at Utica.  The Romans inherited a thriving agriculture developed by the Carthaginians.  The climate was hospitable.  Wheat and barley were the most important cereals; wine and olive oil were also produced and there were various fruit trees.

<!--## Sublocation-->

<!--
[AREA WITHIN LOCATION, LIKE “PALATINE HILL”](GEOREFERENCE LINK)
A sublocation is any area larger than an individual garden, but located within a location. I would always try to include a link to a controlled vocabulary here if possible. This ID may well be different from the Garden ID, e.g., Pompeii versus a Garden in one of the houses which has its own Pleiades ID.
