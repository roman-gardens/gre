## Province
[Africa Proconsularis]({{<relref "..">}}) \
[Africa proconsularis (Pleiades)](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/991341)

### Province Description
The history of Roman Africa begins in 146 BC with the destruction of Carthage and the establishment of the province of Africa in the most fertile part of the Carthaginian Empire.  The new province covered about 5000 square miles (17,172 square kilometers) of the northern part of modern Tunisia.  A *praetor* governed the area from his headquarters at Utica.  The Romans inherited a thriving agriculture developed by the Carthaginians.  The climate was hospitable.  Wheat and barley were the most important cereals; wine and olive oil were also produced and there were various fruit trees.

## Location
[UTHINA (Oudna)]({{<relref ".">}}) \
[UTHINA (Oudna) Tunisia(Pleiades)](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/315247)

### Location Description
Uthina was a town in the province of Africa Proconsularis, now northern Tunisia. Uthina became a Roman colony of veterans of Legio XIII Gemina during the reign of Emperor Augustus. Hence, it was mentioned by Ptolemy (IV, 3, 34), Pliny the Elder, and the Tabula Peutingeriana.

From the accounts given by geographers the site seems to be the ruins that form the archeological site of Oudna, near a station on the railway from Tunis to Kef and not far from what was the World War II Oudna Airfield. These ruins occupy a surface nearly three miles in circumference, covering a hilly plateau, and commanding the left bank of the Milian wady; there are remains of a fortress, cisterns, an aqueduct, a triumphal arch, a theatre, an amphitheater, a basilica with a circular crypt, and a bridge. Many mosaics are to be found there as well.

<!--## Sublocation-->

<!--
[AREA WITHIN LOCATION, LIKE “PALATINE HILL”](GEOREFERENCE LINK)
A sublocation is any area larger than an individual garden, but located within a location. I would always try to include a link to a controlled vocabulary here if possible. This ID may well be different from the Garden ID, e.g., Pompeii versus a Garden in one of the houses which has its own Pleiades ID.
