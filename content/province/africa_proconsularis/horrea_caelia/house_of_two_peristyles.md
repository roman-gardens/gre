### Province Description
The history of Roman Africa begins in 146 BC with the destruction of Carthage and the establishment of the province of Africa in the most fertile part of the Carthaginian Empire. The new province covered about 5000 square miles (17,172 square kilometers) of the northern part of modern Tunisia. A praetor governed the area from his headquarters at Utica. The Romans inherited a thriving agriculture developed by the Carthaginians. The climate was hospitable. Wheat and barley were the most important cereals; wine and olive oil were also produced and there were various fruit trees.

<!--
[AREA WITHIN LOCATION, LIKE “PALATINE HILL”](GEOREFERENCE LINK)
A sublocation is any area larger than an individual garden, but located within a location. I would always try to include a link to a controlled vocabulary here if possible. This ID may well be different from the Garden ID, e.g., Pompeii versus a Garden in one of the houses which has its own Pleiades ID.

### Garden Description
 This large house (850 to 900m2) was built on the sea front and was laid out around a peristyle garden. The eastern part of the *domus* was destroyed by the sea; the western portico is complete, only a part of the north and south porticoes of the peristyle have survived. The peristyle was approximately 200 m2 and its porticoes were separated from the garden by a low wall to which a basin was later added.

 The house has known some modifications, one of which was the construction of a private bath that may have had a peristyle garden. The house was occupied between the second and the fourth centuries.

 When the house was transformed into a church during the middle of the IVth century the garden of the peristyle may have been maintained.
