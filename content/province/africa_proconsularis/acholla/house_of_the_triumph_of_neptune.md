## Province
[Africa Proconsularis]({{<relref "..">}}) \
[Africa proconsularis (Pleiades)](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/991341)

### Province Description
The history of Roman Africa begins in 146 BC with the destruction of Carthage and the establishment of the province of Africa in the most fertile part of the Carthaginian Empire.  The new province covered about 5000 square miles (17,172 square kilometers) of the northern part of modern Tunisia.  A *praetor* governed the area from his headquarters at Utica.  The Romans inherited a thriving agriculture developed by the Carthaginians.  The climate was hospitable.  Wheat and barley were the most important cereals; wine and olive oil were also produced and there were various fruit trees.

[Acholla (Pleiades)](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/324653)

### Location Description
The city of Acholla was established forty-five km north of Sfax, along the seashore of the coast of Bysacena. When the city took sides with Rome in the third Punic war, Acholla was rewarded with the status of a free city. Later, under Hadrian, the city became a municipum. Production of oil from the countryside, inner cities of Bararus and Thysdrus, and commerce by sea made Acholla, with its harbor, a prosperous town.  Two baths and a series of houses testify to the wealth of the inhabitants of Acholla by the opulence and the originality of their mosaic décor. The mosaic decor gives evidence to the presence of one of the first mosaic workshops in Africa.

[AREA WITHIN LOCATION, LIKE “PALATINE HILL”](GEOREFERENCE LINK)
A sublocation is any area larger than an individual garden, but located within a location. I would always try to include a link to a controlled vocabulary here if possible. This ID may well be different from the Garden ID, e.g., Pompeii versus a Garden in one of the houses which has its own Pleiades ID.

### Garden Description
The fully excavated House of the Triumph of Neptune (1172 m2) is situated in the northern part of the city.  The house has a complete peristyle with one aisle entrance situated indirectly from the northeast (Plan view, Fig. 1).  Opposite the entry, the western wing of the house is organized with a vast colonnaded *oecus-triclinium* in the center.  On both sides of the *oecus-triclinium* there are two apartments with four rooms each and a passage to a non-paved rectangular court.  There is another *triclinium* on the south side of the peristyle and a reception room opening onto the north portico.

A low wall encloses the peristyle (17.50 x 14.50 m) with its garden (VII; 11.40 x 9.10 m).  The low wall curves to form three apses facing the tripartite entry of the *oecus-triclinium*.  The preserved walls of the garden show the level of the soil at ca. 0.65 m, which is under the level of the porticos’ mosaics.  On those walls, there were small remains of paintings depicting a fence with touches of green foliage on black or brown.  It was probably a garden view.  A small basin was placed later in the northeast corner.

Two open spaces with an earthen floor, probably small gardens, were arranged in both apartments and were accessible by a passage.  It is possible that the north and south walls of the *oecus-triclinium* might have had a window opening onto these courtyard gardens.

Another possible garden was adjacent to the reception room of the northern aisle of the portico.  This house dates from 150-170 A.D.
