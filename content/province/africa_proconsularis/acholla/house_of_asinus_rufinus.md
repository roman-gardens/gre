## Province
[Africa Proconsularis]({{<relref "..">}}) \
[Africa proconsularis (Pleiades)](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/991341)

### Province Description
The history of Roman Africa begins in 146 BC with the destruction of Carthage and the establishment of the province of Africa in the most fertile part of the Carthaginian Empire.  The new province covered about 5000 square miles (17,172 square kilometers) of the northern part of modern Tunisia.  A *praetor* governed the area from his headquarters at Utica.  The Romans inherited a thriving agriculture developed by the Carthaginians.  The climate was hospitable.  Wheat and barley were the most important cereals; wine and olive oil were also produced and there were various fruit trees.

## Location

[Acholla (Henchir Botria)]({{<relref ".">}}) \
[Acholla (Pleiades)](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/324653)

### Location Description
The city of Acholla was established forty-five km north of Sfax, along the seashore of the coast of Bysacena. When the city took sides with Rome in the third Punic war, Acholla was rewarded with the status of a free city. Later, under Hadrian, the city became a municipum. Production of oil from the countryside, inner cities of Bararus and Thysdrus, and commerce by sea made Acholla, with its harbor, a prosperous town.  Two baths and a series of houses testify to the wealth of the inhabitants of Acholla by the opulence and the originality of their mosaic décor. The mosaic decor gives evidence to the presence of one of the first mosaic workshops in Africa.

[AREA WITHIN LOCATION, LIKE “PALATINE HILL”](GEOREFERENCE LINK)
A sublocation is any area larger than an individual garden, but located within a location. I would always try to include a link to a controlled vocabulary here if possible. This ID may well be different from the Garden ID, e.g., Pompeii versus a Garden in one of the houses which has its own Pleiades ID.

### Garden Description
The house of *Asinius Rufinus* (Approx.
835 m2) is located in the center of the city.  Towards the south its façade extends along an open area partially excavated and is interpreted as the possible forum of the city.  The house contains a mosaic pavement of Hercules and an inscription located in the main entrance hall with the honorific cursus of M. *Asinius Rufinus*, who was consul between 184 and 185. *Rufinus* most likely changed the older house (from Tiberian times) to this new one opened towards the South.  Therefore the data attributed to this phase of the house comes from the second half of the II century AD, during the reign of Commodus.

The house’s incomplete excavation (Plan view, Fig. 1) includes a small entrance and several shops opening onto a non-excavated street oriented towards the North.  The various rooms of the house were laid out around a complete peristyle: the *triclinium* and two apartments in the south, an apartment on the east, two unpaved spaces on the north and a *lararium* (XIX) on the northwest.  A staircase indicates that the house had an upper level.

The low wall of four porticos spanned the *viridarium* of the peristyle (13.65 x 10.70 m), which curves to form an apse in front of the *triclinium* (IV) located on the south.  In the *viridarium* there was a cistern.  Access to the *viridarium* and cistern was provided under the north portico, between the 6th and 7th column.  If the low wall had been stuccoed and painted as the columns were, there are currently no traces of painting on the *viridarium* side of it.  Mortar channels along the north and the west of the garden collected the water from the roof and brought it to one of the cisterns located in the southwest corner of the garden.  The soil of the garden has not been examined.

Adjacent to the east apartment is a light well with an earthen floor, which can be regarded as a small garden (IX).  A large window in room VIII opened into this garden (IX).
