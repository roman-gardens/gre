## Province
[Africa Proconsularis]({{<relref "..">}}) \
[Africa proconsularis (Pleiades)](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/991341)

### Province Description
The history of Roman Africa begins in 146 BC with the destruction of Carthage and the establishment of the province of Africa in the most fertile part of the Carthaginian Empire.  The new province covered about 5000 square miles (17,172 square kilometers) of the northern part of modern Tunisia.  A praetor governed the area from his headquarters at Utica.  The Romans inherited a thriving agriculture developed by the Carthaginians.  The climate was hospitable.  Wheat and barley were the most important cereals; wine and olive oil were also produced and there were various fruit trees.

### Location Description
Hadrumetum is located on the bay of Hammamet at the edge of the fertile region of Sahel from which it drew its wealth.  Choosing the side of Rome against Carthage during the Punic war, Hadrumetum was rewarded with the status of free town. Taking the side of Pompey, the city was heavily fined by Caesar after his victory at Thapsus. Nevertheless, the opulence of its houses adorned with luxurious mosaics testifies that the city experienced great economic development after its elevation to the status of colony, under Trajan.

<!--## Sublocation-->

<!--
[AREA WITHIN LOCATION, LIKE “PALATINE HILL”](GEOREFERENCE LINK)
A sublocation is any area larger than an individual garden, but located within a location. I would always try to include a link to a controlled vocabulary here if possible. This ID may well be different from the Garden ID, e.g., Pompeii versus a Garden in one of the houses which has its own Pleiades ID.

### Garden Description
In this incomplete house, the peristyle-garden was bounded by a low wall that curved to make six semi-circular niches facing the galleries of the peristyle (Plan view, Fig. 1). The two niches located on the East-West axis of the *triclinium* are wider with the one facing the *triclinium* containing a basin with a marine mosaic. The house is dated to the II c.
