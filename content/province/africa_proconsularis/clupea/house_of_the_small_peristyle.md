## Province
[Africa Proconsularis]({{<relref "..">}}) \
[Africa proconsularis (Pleiades)](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/991341)

### Province Description
The history of Roman Africa begins in 146 BC with the destruction of Carthage and the establishment of the province of Africa in the most fertile part of the Carthaginian Empire.  The new province covered about 5000 square miles (17,172 square kilometers) of the northern part of modern Tunisia.  A praetor governed the area from his headquarters at Utica.  The Romans inherited a thriving agriculture developed by the Carthaginians.  The climate was hospitable.  Wheat and barley were the most important cereals; wine and olive oil were also produced and there were various fruit trees.

## Location

### Location Description
The city was built along the slope of the hill several kilometers northwest of the present town. Excavations revealed the Capitol and an important residential district descending in successive levels towards the bank.

<!--## Sublocation-->

<!--
[AREA WITHIN LOCATION, LIKE “PALATINE HILL”](GEOREFERENCE LINK)
A sublocation is any area larger than an individual garden, but located within a location. I would always try to include a link to a controlled vocabulary here if possible. This ID may well be different from the Garden ID, e.g., Pompeii versus a Garden in one of the houses which has its own Pleiades ID.

### Garden Description
This small house (320 m²) is located on the lower part of the hill, south of the House of *Marcus Aurelius*.  The plan is characteristic of small houses with a peristyle (Plan view, Fig. 1).  The west part of the house is occupied by a large *triclinium* E opening onto the peristyle.  Four other rooms paved with mosaics are laid on the north aisle.  Surrounding the mortared courtyard H a low wall interweaves between the columns, creating a semi-circular exedra on the eastern side H4. Tis courtyard may have been planted at an earlier phase.
Possibly belonging to this same house, the east part of the *domus* may have been a garden with a basin b in the northern corner. The house is dated from the Ist century A.D.
