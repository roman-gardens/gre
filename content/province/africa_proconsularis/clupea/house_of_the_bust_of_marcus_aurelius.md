[Africa proconsularis (Pleiades)](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/991341)

### Province Description
The history of Roman Africa begins in 146 BC with the destruction of Carthage and the establishment of the province of Africa in the most fertile part of the Carthaginian Empire.  The new province covered about 5000 square miles (17,172 square kilometers) of the northern part of modern Tunisia.  A praetor governed the area from his headquarters at Utica.  The Romans inherited a thriving agriculture developed by the Carthaginians.  The climate was hospitable.  Wheat and barley were the most important cereals; wine and olive oil were also produced and there were various fruit trees.

### Location Description
The city was built along the slope of the hill several kilometers northwest of the present town. Excavations revealed the Capitol and an important residential district descending in successive levels towards the bank.

<!--
[AREA WITHIN LOCATION, LIKE “PALATINE HILL”](GEOREFERENCE LINK)
A sublocation is any area larger than an individual garden, but located within a location. I would always try to include a link to a controlled vocabulary here if possible. This ID may well be different from the Garden ID, e.g., Pompeii versus a Garden in one of the houses which has its own Pleiades ID.

## Garden
House of the Bust of Marcus Aurelius (Maison du Buste de Marc Aurèle)

### Keywords
<!-- [urban villas](#) -->

### Garden Description
This domus (ca. 1000 m²) has a large central garden (250 m²) enclosed by a peristyle (20.20 x 21.40 m, 432.30 m²) (Plan view, Fig. 1).  The northwest wing seems the most important area of the house.  It had a large corridor that opened onto a portico with a view toward the garden.  In the garden, along the axis of the main reception room, a semi-circular aedicula was installed on a cistern where fragments of Marcus Aurelius bust were found.  On the south side of the garden was a semi-circular pool.

The wing that is perpendicular to the northwest one was comprised of a series of rooms built against the hill.  All rooms were paved with mosaics and belonged to a latter phase.  Rooms located on the higher level beyond this wing had a large panoramic view of the sea.
