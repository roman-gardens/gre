## Province
[Africa Proconsularis]({{<relref "..">}}) \
[Africa proconsularis (Pleiades)](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/991341)

### Province Description
The history of Roman Africa begins in 146 BC with the destruction of Carthage and the establishment of the province of Africa in the most fertile part of the Carthaginian Empire.  The new province covered about 5000 square miles (17,172 square kilometers) of the northern part of modern Tunisia.  A praetor governed the area from his headquarters at Utica.  The Romans inherited a thriving agriculture developed by the Carthaginians.  The climate was hospitable.  Wheat and barley were the most important cereals; wine and olive oil were also produced and there were various fruit trees.

## Location

[Aspis/Clupea (Kelibia)]({{<relref ".">}}) \
[Aspis/Clupea (Pleiades)](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/314892)

### Location Description
The city was built along the slope of the hill several kilometers northwest of the present town. Excavations revealed the Capitol and an important residential district descending in successive levels towards the bank.

<!--
[AREA WITHIN LOCATION, LIKE “PALATINE HILL”](GEOREFERENCE LINK)
A sublocation is any area larger than an individual garden, but located within a location. I would always try to include a link to a controlled vocabulary here if possible. This ID may well be different from the Garden ID, e.g., Pompeii versus a Garden in one of the houses which has its own Pleiades ID.

### Garden Description
Known for its beautiful hunting scene mosaics, this large *domus* (1100m²) was laid out around a square shaped peristyle-garden (15.50x15m) (Plan view, Fig. 1). The low wall of four porticos enclosed the *viridarium*, which curves to form an apse in front of the *oecus*. The house was constructed on the remains of an old salt factory; the three basins located on the east side of the garden are the remains of the previous phase of the building.

The house is dated to the 5th-6th century AD on the base of the style of its mosaics, however stratigraphical and archaeological evidence shows previous building phases and supplies a *terminus post quem* to the second half of the 2nd century - first half of the 3rd century.
