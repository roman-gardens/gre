## Province

[Africa proconsularis (Pleiades)](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/991341)

### Province Description

The history of Roman Africa begins in 146 BC with the destruction of Carthage and the establishment of the province of Africa in the most fertile part of the Carthaginian Empire. The new province covered about 5000 square miles (17,172 square kilometers) of the northern part of modern Tunisia. A praetor governed the area from his headquarters at Utica. The Romans inherited a thriving agriculture developed by the Carthaginians. The climate was hospitable. Wheat and barley were the most important cereals; wine and olive oil were also produced and there were various fruit trees.

## Location

[[THUBURBO MAIUS (Henchir Kasbat), Tunisia (Pleiades)](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/315220)

### Location Description

The city occupies the slopes of a hill in a fertile grain producing area about 50 kilometers to the south of Tunis. Originally a settlement of mercenary soldiers after the fall of Carthage, it was raised to amunicipium by Hadrian (117-138), and to a colony during therein of Commodus (177-192). The chief public buildings and the most beautiful homes date from this period. After the crisis of the Empire during the third century, Thuburbo saw a rebirth in the fourth century; but as imperial authority declined the city became a mere village.

### Garden Description

The market located to the SW of the forum had a peristyle that enclosed an open space that may have been planted. With no evidence, Merlin suggested that the courtyard was paved with white mosaics but scholars do not agree.  A large shade tree grows there today.
