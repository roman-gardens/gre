## Province
[Africa Proconsularis]({{<relref "..">}}) \
[Africa proconsularis (Pleiades)](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/991341)

### Province Description
The history of Roman Africa begins in 146 BC with the destruction of Carthage and the establishment of the province of Africa in the most fertile part of the Carthaginian Empire.  The new province covered about 5000 square miles (17,172 square kilometers) of the northern part of modern Tunisia. A *praetor* governed the area from his headquarters at Utica.  The Romans inherited a thriving agriculture developed by the Carthaginians.  The climate was hospitable.  Wheat and barley were the most important cereals; wine and olive oil were also produced and there were various fruit trees.

## Location

[UTICA (Utique)]({{<relref ".">}}) \
[UTICA (Utique) Tunisia(Pleiades)](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/315248)

### Location Description
Her geographic situation made of Utica one of the oldest and well-known Phoenician settlements. In 146 B.C, Utica became the capital of the newly created province of Africa and the residence of the governor. With the triumph of Caesar and the resurgence of Carthage, Utica's supremacy would gradually decline under the empire. In 36 B.C. it became a *municipium* and a colony under Hadrian.

The city was laid out on a grid plan. Numerous buildings have been uncovered, among them the forum, several temples and baths, an amphitheater, a circus, and opulent houses. Many of these buildings of the Republican period were, during the imperial era, replaced by others larger and more luxurious. This explains the existence of two theaters for example, the one fitted into the side of the hill, the other built in open country. Enormous cisterns were constructed, fed by an aqueduct. Still extant on the summit of the acropolis overlooking the town, is a quadrangular edifice habitually referred to as “the citadel,” which could perhaps be simply a water tower.

<!--
[AREA WITHIN LOCATION, LIKE “PALATINE HILL”](GEOREFERENCE LINK)
A sublocation is any area larger than an individual garden, but located within a location. I would always try to include a link to a controlled vocabulary here if possible. This ID may well be different from the Garden ID, e.g., Pompeii versus a Garden in one of the houses which has its own Pleiades ID.

### Garden Description

The House is located in the *insula* II (Lots 1,7). The peristyle garden had a semicircular basin extending from the two middle columns on the S side, facing the *triclinium* (XVII) during the first century AD (Plan view, Fig.1). When the house was substantially altered in the second century the enlargement of the curb on the adjoining well destroyed half of the basin. At the same time the *oecus* was subdivided into several rooms, the courtyard was paved.
