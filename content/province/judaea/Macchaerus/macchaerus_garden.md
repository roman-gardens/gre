## Province

[Judaea]({{<relref "..">}}) \
[Iudaea (province) (Pleiades)](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/981527)

## Province Description
Judaea, the Roman province, included parts of the areas of the [Hasmonean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasmonean_dynasty) and [Herodium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodian_dynasty) kingdoms, notably Biblical Judah, Samaria, and Edom. Its capital was Caesarea Maritima. Roman influence in the region began in 63 CE, when the Roman general [Pompey the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompey) took over Syria from Mithridates and, coming into Jerusalem, occupied the Second Temple.  Pompey appointed [Antipater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipater_the_Idumaean), the father of Herod, as the first Roman Procurator. Later these ties allowed [Herod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herod_the_Great) to seek backing from Rome against the Hasmoneans in 40 BCE, when the senate recognized him as “king of the Jews.”  His territories came to include the regions of Galilee, Gaulanitis (the Golan),Peraea and the Decapolis. Herod balanced his allegiance to Rome with the independence of his kingdom, often employing architectural projects to express his ambitions and control of nature to express his capacity to rule . His many palaces, placed strategically around the kingdom, feature dramatically designed landscapes and gardens.  Upon his death, his heirs were unable to maintain order and Judea was annexed to Syria in 6 CE, although it was assigned its own procurator.   By the time of [Trajan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan), Judea was reduced in size and the Herodian palaces abandoned, preserving them over the millennia for archaeologists. [Hadrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian) renamed the province Syria Palaestina after the [Bar Kochba revolts (132-135)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Kokhba_revolt) provoked him to erase the name of Judea.  
The period for which we have the richest evidence of a garden culture in this region is during the reign of [Herod the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herod_the_Great).  A client king of Rome, Herod’s relationships with [Mark Antony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Antony), [Cleopatra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleopatra), [Augustus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus) and [Marcus Agrippa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Vipsanius_Agrippa) and other officials have been preserved in the texts of [Flavius Josephus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus).  These constitute a rare record of interactions between Rome and its territories, and provide a valuable context for understanding the trends of design in the early imperial period.  The proximity of Judea to Alexandria, whose palaces and gardens lie beneath the modern city and its harbors, may also provide a suggestion of the late Hellenistic garden culture that Romans emulated.  Evidence of gardens in the Hasmonean winter palaces at Jericho and the palaces of Hyracanus the Tobiad on the other side of the Jordan Valley provide rare cases where texts can illuminate archaeological evidence.   These gardens require further investigation and both are threatened by local development.
This geography of Judaea comprises a wide variety of biomes, from richly watered plains of the Galilee and the Jordan, to the semi arid Judean Hills, the humid, fertile coastal plain of the Mediterranean, and the deserts of the Dead Sea valley and the Negev.



## Location

[Macchaerus]({{<relref ".">}}) \
[Macchaerus (Pleiades)](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/687917)

### Location Description

Josephus describes the citadel of Macchaerus in detail (JB VII, 6) as the location where John the Baptist was imprisoned and executed by Herod Antipas.  The German explorer, Ulrich Jasper Seetzen located it for publication in 1807.  The site lies east of the Dead Sea in Transjordan.  Excavations were conducted by Vardaman in June 1968, by Corbo and Piccirillo in 1978-1981 and 1992-1993.  In 2008, the Hungarian Academy of Arts resumed work.

<!--Herodian Entertainment Complex, Third Palace


<!--
[AREA WITHIN LOCATION, LIKE “PALATINE HILL”](GEOREFERENCE LINK)
A sublocation is any area larger than an individual garden, but located within a location. I would always try to include a link to a controlled vocabulary here if possible. This ID may well be different from the Garden ID, e.g., Pompeii versus a Garden in one of the houses which has its own Pleiades ID.


### Sublocation Description

The third palace built by Herod in the late first century B.C. merits special mention with regard to the integration of water, gardens and landscape. This palace was sited along a straight section of Wadi Qelt to take advantage of its season flow of water each winter.  This area was, however, lower than those on which the first and second palaces had been built, offering a more limited view of the surroundings.  This shortcoming was offset by the erection of a viewing pavilion on top of an artificial tel.  The overall building complex was rectilinear, with Wadi Qelt cutting through the center, and a bridge spanning the two halves.  On the north side lay a complex of banqueting rooms, Roman style baths, reception rooms, peristyle courtyards and colonnaded walks.   On the south lay a great sunken garden, the artificial tel and pavilion, and, off-axis, a shallow boating pool. (Fig. 6) The garden features are discussed individually below.-->

### Garden Description

During the architectural survey in 2010, the team excavated a 4 x 2m trench to the west of the storerooms and east of the bath quarter.  Working to a depth of 2m, the archaeologists encountered one meter of homogenous soil over the artificial stone terrace.  The only artifact found was a Herodian lamp.  The soil was sealed off from the terrace by a layer of hydraulic mortar.  After thorough examination of the stratigraphic section we were able to establish that the southern courtyard of the Herodian places was filled with soil, creating a place for a royal garden.  It is the only possible location for a garden within the walls of the citadel, and thus corresponds with description by Josephus.
"Now within this place [inside Machaerus] there grew a sort of rue [Ruta] that deserves our wonder on account of its largeness, for it was no way inferior to any fig tree whatsoever, either in height or in thickness; and the report is, that it had lasted ever since the times of Herod, and would probably have lasted much longer, had it not been cut down by those Jews who took possession of the place afterward." (Josephus, War VII 6, 3)
Water was supplied to the garden from cisterns built in the Herodian and Hasmonean times (Vörös 2012, 534-535). Like other gardens of Herod, it lay near a bath complex and may have used the water draining from the bath.
