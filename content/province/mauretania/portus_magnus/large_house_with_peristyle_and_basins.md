## Province

[Mauretania]({{<relref "..">}}) \
[Mauretania Caesariensis (province)(Pleiades)](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/981532)

## Province Description

An ancient district of Africa in Roman times, Mauretania lay west of Numidia and covered most of present-day Morocco and western Algeria. By the second century BCE, when Jugurtha of Numidia was rebelling against Rome, Jugurtha’s father-in-law Bocchus had most of Mauretania under his control. In 25 BCE Augustus appointed Juba II as ruler of Mauretania. Claudius divided it into two provinces: Mauretania Caesariensis, with Caesarea (modern Cherchel) as capital, and Mauretania Tingitana, with Tingis (modern Tangier) as capital. By the end of the 5th century CE, the province had disappeared.

{{< figure src="../images/large_house_with_peristyle_and_basins_fig_1.png" alt="Plan of Large House with peristyle and basins in Portus Magnus. The principle entry to the house is along the north wall, centered on the symmetrical floor plan. A rectangular entry room (longer than wide) gives a view of small gardens to each side, framing the primary hallway linking the northern half of the house to the large, central peristyle garden. Groups of rooms frame the east and west sides of this garden, with a long hallway extending along the southern edge of the house, linking additional rooms to the east and west not shown in the plan. A small room extends from this southern wall, directly opposite the northern entrance." title="Fig. 1: Plan of Large House with peristyle and basins in Portus Magnus (Rights Statement)">}}
