 ## House
 House of M. Loreius Tiburtinus [Della Corte]; of D. Octavius Quartio [Spinazzola]


## Garden
Large garden planted with trees and decorated with a water channel (euripus), garden paintings, garden statues, and a [biclinium](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300170371) and triclinium](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004359). Inside, a spacious [peristyles (Roman courtyards)](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004029) with [fountains](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006179) was decorated with flowers in planting boxes and ornamentals.

### Garden Description
A. The spacious Tuscan [atrium](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004097) of this luxurious house excavated in 1918-1921 was a lavish garden. A low, double masonry wall, faced with marble on the outside, bordered the [impluvium](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300129867) and according to Spinazzola, the space between the walls had been lined with wood to form a planting box for flowers and ornamentals. The pool had a [fountain](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006179) base, which may have held a statuette, and bases in the center of each side may have held additional statuary. On the north side of the [impluvium](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300129867) pipe remains, as well as the cavity where the pipe emerged from under the south base, were excavated. Bombing during WWII extensively damaged the other two sides but these have since been restored.  

B. At the rear of the atrium a modest [peristyles (Roman courtyards)](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004029) garden was enclosed by a [portico](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145) on the east, north and west sides. The supporting columns were smooth and colored red at the base, and fluted and white at the top. A very low wall joined all of the columns. Two circular beds in the center of the garden and a bed bordering the edges with a path between, entered from the south, were shown on the large plan by Spinazzola (see p.376).  Although a dot in the center of each circular bed could represent a root cavity, no mention is made of soil contours or root cavities. A glazed terra-cotta statuette of Bes, the Egyptian deity (Pompeii inv. no. 2897) and of a pharaoh (Pompeii inv. no. 2898) were found but indications were that many other statuettes from this garden had been carried away by ancient excavators.  

C. A vine covered [portico](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145) terrace stretched across the back of the house immediately behind the [peristyles (Roman courtyards)](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004029). Animal paintings decorated the north wall of the terrace. There were two panels of deteriorating images that had been quickly rendered. Lions, lionesses, tigers and leopards pursuing bulls, deer, gazelles and hares were noted by Spinazzola. Jashemski recorded seeing the faded images of a deer, lion, and a bull and several unidentified images in the west panel. She reported that the east panel was in poor condition but she could make out lions and a deer being attacked by an unnamed animal. At the east end of the terrace, between two masonry couches of a [biclinium](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300170371) (l. imus 2.78; l. summus 3.40 m.), two columns framed an [aedicules](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300002574) niche. To the wall right of the niche was a painting of Pyramus and Thisbe, to the left a painting of Narcissus. A marble telamon in the form of a kneeling satyr (Pompeii inv. no. 2891) found on the terrace was thought by Spinazzola to have been a fountain head. This would have stood on the [aedicules](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300002574) with a basin on his shoulders, spilling water down into the channel. Dr. Salza Prina Ricotti disagreed, pointing out that there is no evidence of piping either in the [aedicules](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300002574) or the statuette. The channel, or euripus, measured 1.00 m. wide and 1.40 m. deep and extended 20 m. along the terrace. The inside of the channel was painted blue and small statues were set in the narrow strip of garden along the sides. Proceeding from east to west, the statues were as follows: on the south side, the head of a bearded Dionysus (Pompeii inv. no. 2910); across the channel on the north side, the bust of a young Dionysus (Pompeii inv. no. 2918); next on the south, a lion holding a ram’s head (Pompeii inv. no. 2922); across from this, a lion devouring an antelope (Pompeii inv. no. 2929); next on the south, the mask of a woman sculptured in a console (Pompeii inv. no. 2928); opposite this, a sphinx (Pompeii inv. no. 2930); next on the north side, a seated baby satyr with head and hands raised (Pompeii inv. no. 2931)(this piece disappeared in 1960); an infant Hercules strangling two serpents (Pompeii inv. no. 2932); opposite this, a greyhound attacking a hare (Pompeii inv. no. 2934). A bearded river god (Pompeii inv. no. 2932) looked down the channel from its source, and on the base between the pillars of the [portico](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145) stood a statue of the Muse Polyhymnia (Pompeii inv. no. 2917) and one of Mnemosyne (Pompeii inv. no. 2909). These two marble statues bore traces of paint. The channel was crossed by two small bridges, one crossing by the [biclinium](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300170371). The other crossed in front of the grand triclinium opening just off the north side of the terrace. The [triclinium](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004359) offered a view across the bridge to a tetrastyle pavilion. Here fountains spouted water into the channel at the edge of the plinth of the pavilion. The lower garden that extended the length of the [insula](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300000325) could be viewed from this point.  

D. A nymphaeum in the lower garden was located directly under the tetrastyle pavilion. Water cascaded into this from the pavilion and the upper channel. Brightly colored paintings of fish surrounded a marble mask of a water deity on the rear wall of the [nymphaeum](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006809). Just below, seated above little marble steps where the water tumbled down to the channel, was a marble amorino holding a mask (0.236 m. high; Pompeii inv. no. 20513). The narrow channel continued more than 50 meters down the length of the garden and was interrupted by three structures. Before the first pergola, three jets of water issued from two low columns and a pillar spaced evenly in the channel. The vine covered [pergolas](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006783) covered an elaborate fountain where water issued from the center of the structure and flowed down four steps in four directions to the pool. A small pavilion was built over the next pool and the final pool had another vine covered [pergolas](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006783) shading a jet of water near the end of the channel. Although this series of pools and channels varied, they were all connected as one feature. Spinazzola suggested that the pools were used for raising different species of fish which would have separate habitat requirements. Shade and cover for the fish would have been supplied by the pavilion and hollows in the first marble fountain.  

There was evidence of long vine [arbors](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006781) on each side of the channel and cavities of large shade trees lined the side walls, although no measurements were recorded. On the east side of the garden by the row of shade trees, forty-four [amphorae](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300148696) were found buried in the soil. Rows of smaller trees or shrubs filled the area between the shade trees and the [arbors](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006781).   

A masonry [triclinium](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004359) stood to the east of the first fountain and here two sculptured supports for a marble table were found. The west side of the covered passageway once had wooden benches, and near the wall at the south end of the garden a one-third life size statuette of a sleeping hermaphrodite (Pompeii inv. no. 3021) was discovered. An entrance from the Via di Castricio allowed direct access to the garden.
