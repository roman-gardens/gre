## Garden
A small garden with pools to the rear of a domestic property, in addition to one peristyle garden with decorative elements.

### Garden Description
A. At the rear of the house was a very small garden entered from the [tablinum](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004180). Excavated in 1872, much of the garden was occupied by two small raised [pools](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300008692), according to Mau. Attached to the west wall was a masonry [pool](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300008692) 0.58 m deep on the inside and 0.73 m high on the outside. The other [pool](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300008692) was to the south and there was a garden painting on the rear wall.

B. The [peristyle](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300080971) garden to the east of the [atrium](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004097) was excavated in 1873. It had a [portico](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145) on the north and west supported by two [pillars](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300264605), one at the northwest corner and the other in the middle of the north side. A [gutter](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300052565) sloped towards the southeast corner as it went around the east, north, and west edges of the garden. A shrine-like structure was built against the east wall with the marble veneered façade above the level of the floor of the niche. The niche contained a marble [statuette](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300312262) of Venus, her left arm supported by a [statuette](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300312262) (1.04 m high; Mus Naz. inv. no. 109 608; Ruesch no. 1325). The wall behind the statue was painted to represent blue drapery and the ceiling had a shell-like fluting. Two small marble [statuettes](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300312262) of toads (Mus. Nac. inv. no. 109 609, 109 610) found in the garden and probably the one of two doves (Mus. Naz. inv. no. 120 407) found in the [tablinum](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004180) decorated the flowerbeds. There was also a marble head of a man identified as Agrippa, found cemented in a cup (total height 0.285 m; Mus. Nac. inv. no. 109 611; Reusch no. 1081). The marble statuette of Hercules wrapped in a lion skin (0.70 m high; Mus. Nac. inv. no. 109 677) found in the atrium was probably a garden decoration. The large room on the north had a fine view of the garden and the east and south walls of the garden were decorated with garden paintings. These were separated by narrow panels with a painting of a candelabrum, according to Mau, and each painting featured a fence with an [amphora](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300148696) upon it. Behind this there was a thicket with birds. On either side of the [amphora](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300148696) there was an ibis, and a pheasant in the center. Fiorelli mentioned observing animals in the paintings. Jashemski notes that no trace of the paintings remained when she examined the site; she has never seen a pheasant represented in any garden paintings.
