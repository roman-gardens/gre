## Garden Description

This *peristyle* garden (f) was entered by way of seven steps from the garden of the House of the Ephebe. This part of the building had once been a se parate house (19). A *portico* supported by seven columns, two of them engaged, enclosed the garden on the north and part of the east side. The columns were plastered masonry, painted white on the top and red on the bottom and each had a rectangular hole, 1.70 m. from the bottom, on the side in line with the other columns. It is speculated that these were for wooden beams that held privacy screens or mats which would shield the garden area from heat and cold. The intercolumniation in front of the *excedra* (g) did not have these holes, as it offered a fine view on the garden. A lead pipe with a tap directed water from the garden above into a *dolium* near the corner column. The pipe attached to the column had been shaped to resemble a snake fountain. Nearby a cistern collected water from the channels on the *portico* roof and a *puteal* was located on the top of the cistern. East–west furrows were preserved in the soil and the south, west and part of the east wall of the garden had garden paintings. Two large niches were located in the north wall of the *portico* east of the garden steps and there was an arched niche in the west wall of the north *portico*. In the *excedra* off the north *portico* a broken herm of Dionysus (0.12 x 0.19), was found, which was possible a garden decoration. <span style="color:green">The walls of this *peristyle* garden were painted with very fine garden paintings on part of the east wall and the other three sides. Slender painted columns complete with painted garlands suspended between them, created the appearance of extending the *portico* and divided the walls into panels. Fig. 3. The excavators found the paintings had been badly damaged, the best preserved was the north panel on the west wall (Jashemski, *Gardens*, vol. 1, fig. 93 on p. 58). This showed a slender marble crater-fountain on a decorated column standing in a semi-circular niche formed by a low lattice fence. A photograph taken at the time of excavation shows that behind the fence the bushes represented were myrtles with an oleander on the right. In the background there was a date palm with lower leaves trimmed and new growth showing. This palm was flanked by two laurel trees (*Laurus nobilis L.*). Various birds occupied the thickets and there was a bird perched on the fence, one on the rim of the fountain and one on one of the garlands. The center panel next to this was partially preserved and what remained was the painting of a shallow, round, bubbling fountain supported by three legs located in a three sided niche formed by the lattice fence. Again there were myrtles behind the fence with a slender cypress on the right. Traces of a date palm remain in the center background. The center of the south wall was occupied by a statuette of Venus standing on a circular base, although this had to be deduced from the part of the painting which survived, which only went knee high on the statue. A fragment of a narrow animal painting survived on the west wall above a garden painting. Fig. 4.</span>
