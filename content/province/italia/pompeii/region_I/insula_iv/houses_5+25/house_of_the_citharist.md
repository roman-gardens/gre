### Garden Description

A. Excavation took place at this large house intermittently from 1853 to 1869. There were three large parallel, adjacent gardens. A portico, supported by seventeen stuccoed columns made of brick and Sarno limestone, enclosed the center garden (a). The columns were red, fluted at the top and plain at the bottom. A gutter went around the perimeter of the garden. A semicircular basin was located at the west end of the garden around which six spectacular bronze animals were discovered in 1861. The bronzes were as follows: a boar with a fountain spouting from its mouth (0.56 m. high; Mus. Naz. inv. no. 4900); two dogs (0.51 and 0.25 m. high; for boar and dogs); a leaping stag with no trace of fountain fittings (0.61 high; Mus. Naz. inv. no. 4902; Reusch no. 823); a lion with an open mouth, possibly for a fountain, which originally stood on his hind legs (039m. high; Mus. Naz. inv. no. 4897; Reusch no. 820); a serpent with a spout in its mouth (0,51 high; Mus. Naz. inv. no. 4898; Reusch no. 822). The Museo Nazionale was said to have preserve the original placements of the statues. After careful study of this Dwyer concluded that the boar would have stood on the projecting spur of the fountain basin with the dogs attacking his from either side of the rim. The leaping lion would have been next to them and the serpent to their right. The stag would have stood on the rim of the basin at the extreme left. The entire group could have been seen from the large room (b) opening off the west portico, which was lacking one column to facilitate the view. (Eschebach incorrectly included this column on his plan.) Two double herms, each representing Bacchus and Ariadne, were found at the edge of the basin. Dwyer was not able to locate these. There eleven marble *oscilla*, six circular ones (*tondi*) (Mus. Naz. inv. nos. 6551, 6642, 6646, 6652, formerly 6667 but now at Pompeii, inv. no. 20486, one with inv. no. unknown). Five had the shape of a *pelta* (Mus. Naz. inv. no. 6660, 6661, 6664, 6665, formerly 6658 but now at Pompeii, inv. no. 20489). These white marble *oscillae* each had an iron hook at the top, but no rod, which indicates that were suspended from the architrave between the columns by a cord. Dwyer suggests that the *peltae* were probably alternated with the round shields. One *oscillum* had a maenad on one side; the rest had a faun or satyr on each side. A large rectangular pool (3.50 m. wide x 10.80 m. long; 1.40 m. deep) was excavated in February 1926 by Maruri. Two high steps (0.45 m. and 0.40 m.) descended into the pool on the west side. A much smaller semicircular pool had been built around these steps and into the larger pool which had been filled with rubble (Fig. 4). This was probably built after the earthquake when the entrance on the Via dell’Abbondanza was joined to the house. The cistern opening in the southwest corner of the garden had a lave *puteal*, but the one in the east portico had no *puteal*. <span style="color:orange"> To the northeast of garden (a) there was a large room (c) which contained garden representations painted on the black *predella* under both of the side panels on the south wall. These were recorded by Spinazzola in drawings (Fig. 4). </span>
