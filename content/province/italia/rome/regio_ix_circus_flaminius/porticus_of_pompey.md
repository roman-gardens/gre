### Garden Description
<!-- -->
Completed in 55 BCE on the [*Campus Martius*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campus_Martius), the [*Porticus Pompeianae*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portico_of_Pompey), or *Porticus of Pompey*, was Rome’s first public park ([Plin. *HN* 37.6.13](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0978.phi001.perseus-lat1:37.6); [Propertius 2.32.11](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0620.phi001.perseus-lat2:2.32) | [Trans.]((https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.aa0016309106?urlappend=%3Bseq=179)); [Vitruvius *De Arch.* 5.9.1](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1056.phi001.perseus-lat1:5.9.1)). Funded by the eastern victories of the general [Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompey), the [*Porticus*](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145) comprised a double [*nemus*](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300008884), enclosed by a [*quadriporticus*](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004101), and a [*curia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curia). The western end of the precinct featured his theater-temple complex. The [Pompeium Theatrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre_of_Pompey) was the first permanent stone [theater](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300007117) constructed in Rome; its [*cavea*](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004734) served as the steps to Pompey’s victory [temple](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300007595), dedicated to his protector, [Venus Victrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_(mythology)).

Caesar was murdered in the *Porticus* on March 15, 44 BCE at the foot of the statue of his rival in front of the [*Curia Pompeia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curia_of_Pompey) ([Cicero *Div.* 2.23](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0474.phi053.perseus-lat2:2.23); [Suetonius *Iul.* 88](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1348.abo011.perseus-lat1:88); [Plutarch *Caes.* 66](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg048.perseus-grc1:66)). The *Porticus* is known primarily from the [Severan Marble Plan (*FUR*)](https://formaurbis.stanford.edu/index.php?field0=all&search0=pompey&op0=and&field1=all&search1=porticus) and ancient sources, but archaeological evidence for ancient garden levels was discovered during work under the Teatro Argentina in 1968-9. The only archaeological remains of the *Porticus* currently visible are the back of the *Curia* and the adjacent [latrines](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300007951) just to the west of the Republican temples of [L’Area Sacra di Largo Argentina](https://www.digitalaugustanrome.org/records/area-sacra-largo-argentina/).

[Vitruvius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitruvius) noted that a *porticus* was often attached to a theater, as in the case of the *Porticus Pompeianae*, to shade the audience from rain ([*De Arch.* 5.9.1](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1056.phi001.perseus-lat1:5.9.1)) and that the planted open space ([*virid\[i\]aria*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/viridarium)) of the *porticus* provided health-benefits, particularly in clearing the eyes ([*De Arch.* 5.9.5](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1056.phi001.perseus-lat1:5.9.5)).

The [Marble Plan and Renaissance drawings of the *FUR*](https://formaurbis.stanford.edu/index.php?field0=all&search0=pompey&op0=and&field1=all&search1=porticus) depicted the *quadriporticus* (180 x 135 m.) as aligned along an east-west axis (Fig. 1). The archaeological evidence suggests that the two elongated rectangles on the Marble Plan depict [Martial’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial) *nemus duplex*, a double sacred grove, in the center of the *Porticus* ([Mart. 2.14.10](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1294.phi002.perseus-lat1:2.14) | [Trans.](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uiug.30112023725069?urlappend=%3Bseq=145)). Excavations of the Teatro Argentina in 1960s revealed garden soils in the center of the *Porticus* for the initial Pompeian phase and the Augustan rebuilding phase of the garden. Later phases were not preserved. Epigraphic evidence has led to the common restoration of two interior *porticus*, which may have replaced the *nemus* design in one of the many re-buildings of the complex (discussed below).

The *porticus* and the garden ([*virid\[i\]aria*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/viridarium)) were designed on the basis of symmetry and proportion, which Vitruvius set out thirty years later. Metrological studies of the garden and architecture demonstrated that the garden was designed symmetrically along a central axis (975 Roman feet) and divided into three smaller rectangles of the harmonious proportions and three overlapping circles of equal size in conjunction with the design of the *porticus*, the theater, and the temple (Fig. 2). On the basis of these analyses, K. L. Gleason argued that the Theater featured a temporary [*scaenae frons*](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300083030) in its original phase, allowing a strong visual relationship between the *porticus*, theater, and temple (Fig. 3). M. Gagliardo and J. Packer have proposed that the theater had a permanent *scaenae frons* from the inception of the complex, blocking the powerful line of sight from the *porticus* towards the Temple of Venus (Fig. 4). Certainly, the *scaenae frons* was erected during the radical remodeling of the complex by Augustus in 32 BCE to downplay the political overtones of Pompey’s complex ([Suet. *Aug.* 31](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1348.abo012.perseus-lat1:31)), as he also transformed the *Curia* into a latrine ([Cassius Dio 47.19.1](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0385.tlg001.perseus-grc1:47.19.1) | [Trans.](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/47*.html)).

The *nemus*, dedicated to Venus Victrix, was planted with evenly spaced ranks of plane trees ([*Platanus orientalis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platanus_orientalis)) ([Pliny *HN* 35.39](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0978.phi001.perseus-lat1:35.39); [Propertius, 2.32.11-12](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0620.phi001.perseus-lat2:2.32)). Other plants may have included the [myrtle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrtus_communis) (*Myrtus communis*), associated with fertility and Venus, and [laurel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurus_nobilis) (*Laurus nobilis*), the symbol of victory, as suggested by P. Grimal. The plane trees lined the central avenue, directing the visitor’s view west to the Theater/Temple of Venus. The lay-out of the double *nemus* and the controlled views of it established a relationship in architecture and greenery between Pompey and Venus.

The double *nemus* also contained [foundations](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300000919) and numerous works of art. [Fountains](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006179) were also present in the *Porticus*, probably in the *nemus duplex* ([Propertius, 2.32.11-12](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0620.phi001.perseus-lat2:2.32)), but their exact location is unknown. Set within the garden and [colonnade](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300002613) of the *Porticus Pompeianae*, as well as the theater, was an extensive [assemblage](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300256847) of art ([Cicero *ad Att.* 4.9.1](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0474.phi057.perseus-lat1:4.9.1) | [Trans.](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015008561121?urlappend=%3Bseq=311)). The ideologically specific collection of art celebrated Pompey’s victories and eastern culture. The Roman sculptor Coponius crafted female representations of the fourteen eastern nations that Pompey had defeated, which were located *circa Pompeium*- probably in the *nemus* ([Pliny *HN* 36.41](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0978.phi001.perseus-lat1:36.41)). A painting of [Alexander the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great) by [Nicias](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nicias-Greek-artist) also had a special place with the complex.

Greek art and sculpture (often with Greek inscriptions) and golden [Pergamene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pergamon) curtains were situated in the colonnades of the *Porticus*. This garden [museum](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300005768) displayed [*manubiae*](https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100132145), the booty from Pompey’s victories, while the Temple to Venus served as a physical reminder of Pompey’s eastern victories and his status as Venus’s favored general. Scholars debate whether Pompey was trying to evoke or copy a [Hellenistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_period) form of monarchy through his display of eastern art; F. Coarelli has argued against such an interpretation, while A. Kuttner has argued in favor. In contrast to the splendor of the rest of the precinct, Pompey’s own residence, which was attached to the complex, was notably modest-“like a dingy to a ship.

The *Porticus Pompeianae* not only functioned as a victory monument and political space, but it was a valued amenity for the people of Rome, where men and women came to meet their lovers or seek new ones ([Propertius 2.32.30](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0620.phi001.perseus-lat2:2.32); [Catullus 55.6](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0472.phi001.perseus-lat1:55); [Ovid *Ars Am.* 1.67, 11.1.11, 11.47.3](http://data.perseus.org/texts/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0959.phi004)).

Augustus’ remodeling of the theater and *porticus* (in 32 BCE), discussed above, minimized the political nature of the space and instead emphasized the *porticus* as a space of pleasure. After a fire in 80 CE, [Domitian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domitian) restored the complex. It also burned during the reign of [Carinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carinus) (283–85 CE) and was restored by [Diocletian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocletian).
