### Garden Description

A *portico* with three columns, red on the bottom, white on the top, enclosed this *peristyle* garden (a) on the north, east and south sides. The excavating work in 1951 revealed a cistern opening at the edge of the north *portico* and a gutter on the north, east and south side of the garden. Paintings of orchards adorned two small *cubicula* (b and c) and gave this house its name.

A. <span style="color:green">The room (b) off the east side of the *atrium* had walls divided horizontally into four zones. At the base there are hart’s-tongue ferns (*Phyllitis scolopendrium* L.) Newman and acanthus (*Acanthus mollis* L.) painted on a black dado. The next band is painted to represent a fence of woven reeds and then a luxuriant garden of trees and flowers beyond with an azure sky above. The other three walls are divided into three panels each by vertical figures that Maiuri describes as trellis supports rather than columns. The door on the west wall leaves room for only a narrow panel on either side. The center of each panel on the north, east, and south walls features a *pinax* or Egyptian statue. Excluded is the west panel on the south wall, for much of the space is taken up by a window. Each of these paintings features a profusion of birds. The upper zone is illustrated with urns, sculptured *pinakes* with Egyptian motifs and garlands from which are suspended masks and round *oscilla* as well as various birds, all against a blue background. The birds in this zone include the egret (*Egretta sp.*), magpie (*Pica pica* L.), blackbird (*Turdus merula* L.), white pigeon/dove (*Streptopelia sp.*), hooded crow (*Corvus corone cornix* L.), and house sparrow (*Passer domesticus italiae Vieillot*). (Jashemski, *Gardens*, vol.1, figs. 117 on p. 74, 171, 173 on pp. 106-107). Identification of the subjects painted is made possible by the extreme attention to detail that the artist utilized. Starting on the east wall, viewed first upon entering, the left panel shows a statue of a standing pharaoh facing a similar statue in the right panel. Behind the pharaoh is a fabulous lemon tree loaded with fruit (Jashemski, *Gardens*, vol. 1, fig 126 on p. 78). The left of the panel has fragments of what was a myrtle with white blossoms, and on the right is an oleander with pink flowers. At the base of the statue are carefully rendered corn poppies (*Papaver rhoeas* L.) (Jashemski, *Gardens*, vol. 1, fig. 118 on p. 75). An oleander bush with deep pink blossoms and a perching bird stands behind a *pinax* in the center panel. The oleander is flanked by what appear to be laurel bushes with whitish flower buds with an additional viburnum (*Viburnum tinus* L.) to the far left and a myrtle on the far right. A white pigeon perched on the fence to the far left looks to the right. The base of the *pinax* has a mound of ivy (*hedera helix subsp. Poetarum Nyman*) covered with bright yellow berries flanked by roses on the right and a plant with four petaled flowers on the left. The standing pharaoh in the right panel was badly damaged but the image of a cherry tree with bright red fruit that stands behind it remains (Jashemski, *Gardens*, vol.1, figs. 117 and 121 on pp. 74 and 75). The damaged images of the plants at the sides of the pharaoh appear to be similar to the other panel with a myrtle on the right and an oleander to the left. It is likely the flowers at the base of the statue were corn poppies. The left panel on the south wall is decorated with a swallow perching in a viburnum bush in full bloom behind a seated pharaoh facing west (Jashemski, *Gardens*, vol. 1, figs. 117 and 122 on p. 74 and 76). A tall, slender laurel with whitish blossoms stands in the left background and an oleander with deep pink blossoms is on the right. Shorter oleanders with pink blossoms grow beside the statue on the left and to the right a short viburnum and myrtle are in bloom. The flowers painted at the base of the statue on the left are poppies, but there is too much damage to confidently identify the remaining yellow to orange flowers along the front. The center panel features a sculptured, painted *pinax*, an oleander with pink blooms behind it and what is probably a female turtledove (*Streptopelia turtur* L.) perched in the branches. A dark bird, possibly a blackbird, is flying to the top to the bush (Jashemski, *Gardens*, vol. 1, fig. 408 on p. 274). Another tall laurel in bloom is painted on the left and a strawberry tree (*Arbutus unedo* L.) displays showy red-ribbed fruit (Jashemski, *Gardens*, vol. 1, fig. 120 on p. 75). A young palm is growing in front of the *pinax* flanked by a myrtle with white blossoms to the on the right and a blossoming oleander to the left. The low flowers on the bottom of the left appear to be roses, but those on the right were completely lost. The paintings around the window in the west panel include a tall oleander on the left of the window and above, identified by the leaves, are a myrtle on the left and a viburnum on the right. Perching above the window is a white dove/pigeon. Left of the window to the bottom are Madonna lilies (*Lilium candidum* L.), found only two other times in the garden paintings of Pompeii that are presently known. On the left of the door in the west wall there is a bush, no blooms, above the fence and an oleander in bloom on the right. The garlands painted on the rest of the walls are missing but a white dove/pigeon on the wing is shown against a clear blue sky on either side of the door. Extensive damage occurred on the north wall. The west panel has a seated pharaoh facing the similar figure on the right panel with a tall viburnum bush in bloom behind. The bushes on either side are so badly damaged that identification is uncertain, perhaps laurels. A short oleander can be identified to the left of the statue while only the outline of four petals flowers survived on the base of this side. The center panel is slightly better preserved; the sculptured, painted *pinax* has a tall flowering oleander in back flanked by a tall laurel on the left and a tall viburnum on the right. The foreground figures are a myrtle in bloom on the left, a short oleander on the right, and a damaged unidentified plant in the center. The flowering plants in the foreground are unidentifiable. A statue of a seated Egyptian is shown on the right panel facing his counterpart on the left. Behind the statue are, from left to right, an oleander, a strawberry tree and a laurel. A shrub and a palm as tall as the statue are located to its left and on the right is a flowering oleander. Damage has completely erased the flowers that were presumably painted at the bottom of this panel.</span>
