# To begin the proccess,  I set out certain criteria for determining archaeological vs. literary gardens

## Here are criteria I came up with that would denote a literary garden:

* [x] A citation for an author *(Pausanias, Strabo, etc.)*
* [x] No mentions of excavations
* [x] No bibliography *(to suggest that the entirety of the descrition is written soley using the evidence presented by the author, and not an external source)*
* [x] No plans *(that would be difficult to obtain should the garden description be of literary origin)*

## So now onto evaluating each of the gardens for these two features:
