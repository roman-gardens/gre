      <description>Province Sicily
Province Description Sicily, the largest island in the Mediterranean, was colonised by Greeks from the later eighth century B. C., with Syracuse becoming the largest and most powerful Greek polis; in time most of the indigenous settlements of the interior also became profoundly Hellenized. The western tip of the island was settled by Phoenicians and later became an outpost of Carthaginian control. In the third century B. C. Sicily became embroiled in the First Punic War which resulted in Rome’s acquisition of the island as its first overseas provincia in 241 B. C.; in 211 B. C. Sicily was above all famed for its agricultural fertility and its capacity to produce exceptional grain yields (wheat and barley), and to a lesser extent wine. By the time of the Roman Empire the principal flourishing cities were located on the coast, with much of the interior given over to scattered agricultural villages, villas and farms.

Garden Villa at Patti Marina
Keywords Garden Description In private housing at this site on the east coast no excavation has so far been attempted to reveal the presence of gardens, and little is known of the arrangements for running water in houses to irrigate such gardens or to supply ornamental pools and fountains. This town house has a small rectangular pool with a small semicircular recess (Farrar Type B) at the south end of the garden peristyle, facing what was presumably the principal dining room at the south end of the house. The precise date is uncertain.

Garden PUBLIC GARDEN, Syracuse
Keywords Garden Description In the Roman period, the clearest evidence for the presence of a formal garden in a public place comes from Syracuse, where an impressive piazza, 175 by 45 meters, was laid out early in the Augustan period on the west side of the third-century B. C. Altar of Hieron (Fig. 2). A U-shaped stoa was erected on three sides, with fourteen columns on the short sides and sixty-four on the long; the Altar itself formed the fourth. Within the area enclosed by this portico, a large rectangular basin was erected in the center, with steps at the corners and a statue base in the middle; a drain led away from the basin westwards under the portico. The open space around the basin was planted systematically with five rows of trees, thirty-two trees in the two outermost rows, and twenty-six in each of the rows interrupted by the pool; there were thus 142 trees (of unknown species) in all (Fig. 3). The arrangement, with its central pool, trees and surrounding porticoes, recalls similar monuments in Campania, such as the Great Palaestra, also of Augustan date, at Pompeii (see Vol. 1, no.), and the Palaestra at Herculaneum (see Vol. 1, no.). The function of the Syracuse square is unknown, but it must have been principally intended as a pleasant park where the townsfolk of Syracuse could stroll, especially, perhaps, when attending events staged in the nearby amphitheater.

Keywords Garden Description There is a four meter square basin located in the middle of the space enclosed by the peristyle (Fig. 6). Belonging to Farrar’s type D, the pool has a square exterior and an inner outline of semicircular corner niches alternating with rectangular recesses. Probably belonging to the first half of the first century A. D., the pool is waterproofed with white mortar inside, and has edges lined with white and grey marble, possibly Carraran (Fig. 7).

The basin has marble wall-veneer and plain tessellation on its floor (Fig 11). This arrangement at Durrueli may have been influenced by North African fashion, where the demi-lune basin is especially common.

Garden Villa at Patti Marina
Keywords Garden Description This fourth-century villa on the north coast has also yielded evidence for a garden (but no ornamental pools). A figured mosaic pavement belonging to an earlier, third-century villa was found inside the courtyard of the later villa, but it had been heavily damaged by cuttings through it for the plants and trees of the garden of the fourth-century villa. Nothing can be said of the layout of the latter in detail as the excavation remains unpublished, but the potential for garden archaeology in the island has at least been demonstrated.

Garden Villa, in the Casale district near Piazza Armerina
Keywords Garden Description The sumptuous fourth-century villa has, not surprisingly, a large and most elaborately-shaped pool at the center of its main peristyle (Farrar Type G: Fig. ): it consists of a rectangular central basin with outward-curving recesses in the middle of the long sides, and two independent demi-lune pools (i.e. with one straight and one curved side, but enclosing overall less than a semicircle) at either end of the short sides; the whole is twenty meters long and nine meters wide (15 on Fig. 12). Its exterior was veneered in marble; the interior was mosaic-lined, with fish depicted on the edge above the water line, and plain tessellation below. Water played from a fountain at the center of the pool, where a small octagonal base was furnished with a vertical lead pipe. The demi-lune pools were wholly marble-lined. A headless marble statuette of a cupid (Fig. 13) and the legs of a second were found in the larger basin: they must have formed a matching pair of statues, set on the pedestals found at either end of the pool. The marble head of a curly-haired young man was also found in the western demi-lune basin (Fig. 14). Nothing is known of the presumed garden surrounding this elaborate pool, but marble slabs set between the columns of the peristyle to restrict access to the central area were carved with stylised dolphins (Fig. 15), and a marble table-support carved with the customary feline on its front face, which was found in the southern peristyle corridor, might also conceivably have come from the garden (Fig. 16). The elliptical court (41) in front of the three-apsed banqueting hall was also provided with two small fountains as well as an elaborate water feature with niches (a nymphaeum) at its west end, but it had no garden, as the area was mosaic-paved (unless the latter is secondary).
