      <description>Province Syria
Province Description In 64 BCE, after his successes in Armenia, Pompey the Great added Syria to the list of annexed eastern provinces of the growing Roman Empire. The conquest of Syria had not been difficult, because the remnants of the once dominant Seleucid Empire had weakened following the defeats of king Antiochus III at Thermopylae in 191 and Magnesia in Asia shortly after. Ultimately, the Seleucids could not withstand the powers of the Nabatean kingdom to the south, the Hasmonean kingdom to the west, and the new threats of Roman hegemony. With the fall of the Seleucids, Rome inherited the majority of Alexander the Great’s former conquests, and the Syrian desert would become a stage for Roman emperors to settle civil conflicts and win triumphs. Smaller Arab settlements sprang up across the region, re-inhabiting Seleucid sites and establishing new ones, and cities such as Palmyra grew in power by taking over the wealthy trade routes of the Nabateans in the second century CE. The Syrian city of Antioch, formerly Seleucia, would become one of the greatest cities of the Roman empire. Although Macedonian presence in the region introduced western styles in art and architecture before the arrival of the Romans, the cities remained Syrian in culture, population and character.
Covering the substantial central part of the Fertile Crescent, the province of Syria sat in an advantageous position between the mountain ranges of eastern Anatolia, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Arabian deserts, and it served as an area of expansion for the larger kingdoms around it. Important trans-Asian trade routes made Syria a key component in the Roman imperial economy, and large navigable rivers, such as the Euphrates and the Orontes, were exploited to connect the Persian Gulf with northern cities. The climate, although arid in the inland mountainous areas, was quite conducive to cultivation. River valleys in the mountain chains skirting the coast provided fertile terrain for agriculture, and the Orontes and Euphrates created well-watered plateaus in the steppe and desert regions of the southeast.
An irrigation system based around the qanat, an underground water channel, was used in Syria during the Roman period to water fields and gardens. Although qanats were likely introduced to the region via the earlier Achaemenid Persian dynasty, it was during the Roman and Byzantine periods that irrigation technology improved, and the majority of known qanats date to this time. The water could flow from these channels into canals, small reservoirs known today as birkas, or large wells. The ancient field systems of Syria have been well studied in areas such as the Hauran, a basalt region in the south. Cereals, olives and grapes were important crops, and were cultivated in either the broad fields on the lowland plains, or long, segmented plots on terraces in the rocky highlands. These terraced plots would have held fruit trees or vineyards.
Location Jebel Khalid
Jebel Khalid (Pleiades)
Location Description A colonial military settlement of Macedonian Greeks on the west bank of the Euphrates in North Syria, established in the wake of Alexander the Great&amp;rsquo;s conquests at a control point on the great river highway of the Euphrates (fig.1: location map of Jebel Khalid; fig. 2: aerial view of Jebel Khalid.) By the time the Jebel Khalid palace was constructed in the course of the third century BCE, these resettled Macedonians had been occupying for half a century not only the royal palaces of the Achaemenids, the powerful fifth and fourth century Persian dynasty, but also the palaces of their satraps, the local governors, and we know from literary testimony that both the royal and local palaces boasted paradeisoi, gardens for pleasure and relaxation. It is therefore reasonable that their Greek successors and replacements adopted in the third century what they found to be one of the agreeable and relaxing amenities enjoyed by their fourth-century Persian predecessors. And from here the concept passed to the Greek builders of elaborate villas as exemplified in Greek South Italy of the second century BCE.
While the general settlement of Jebel Khalid appears to have been systematically abandoned at the end of the Seleucid period (late 70s/early 60s BCE), some seasonal occupation continued into the early Roman period in some of the rooms of the Acropolis Palace. The multiplicity of weak floors in some areas suggests occupation by seasonal pastoralists, and Roman–period coins dating from the third century CE onwards occur in areas of stone-robbing. When major elements of the building eventually collapsed they fell on up to a metre of wind-blown soil – up on the Acropolis high-ground there is not the possibility of alluvial wash-down – implying that the building had stood substantially intact but unroofed for several centuries after its abandonment. The ruins attracted Roman-period scavengers, sightseers and stone robbers, who even scratched graffiti in the plaster of fallen masonry (Clarke: 1992/3).
Garden Acropolis Palace at Jebel Khalid
Keywords  cisterns (plumbing components) colonnades courtyards palaces terrace gardens trenches  Garden Description It is apparent that there was once a large limestone outcrop within the Acropolis at the highest point of the Jebel range, providing panoramic views of the Euphrates valley (figs. 3 and 4: overall plan of the site and ground plan of Acropolis palace). This outcrop was quarried to a rough level terrace, leaving a rocky bluff (and evident quarry face) on the western side, against which a stout retaining wall was built, also serving as the exterior western wall of the building. Nowhere, even in foundation trenches, is there any trace of previous occupation. This building was laid out on a virgin site, or the initial quarrying operations totally cleared away any vestige of any earlier habitation. The coin and stamped amphora handle evidence confirms a third-century BCE construction date.
The building was planned around a square central courtyard, &amp;lsquo;room 26&amp;rsquo; (measurements from central point of column bases are N.17100mm, S.17100mm, E.17800mm, W.17840mm; measurements from the corners of &amp;lsquo;room 26&amp;rsquo; are N.25.3m, S.25.1m, E.26.2m, W.26.0m). The bedrock floor of this courtyard was evidently quarried to drain towards a large cistern in the southeast corner, conveniently located close to a major entertainment room (room 20) with two store-rooms and kitchens (rooms 19 and 21) to either side of it. This cistern is bell-shaped and subsequent excavation has revealed that it was lined with an impermeable plaster; it has a roughly circular mouth, 1.5 meter wide, a depth of 6.6 m, and maximum width of 6.7 m. No well-head was found. While it can be assumed that water from the roofs of the surrounding courtyard rooms was collected, no evidence was found for a drainage system into this cistern, although a settling pond and sluice arrangement has been uncovered by excavation. Indeed, there could have been large pithoi or barrels to collect water from lion-headed waterspouts overhead (fig. 5: example of lion-headed water-spout).
A circular stand was found carved into the bedrock (c. 5 cm deep, 37~38 cm in diameter) by the northern stylobate in the courtyard: it may have served to house a garden pot. (Fig. 6: possible stand for flower pot.) A drain, 4.9 m in length and 14 cm in depth, cut into the bedrock across the colonnade floor on the southwestern side of the courtyard have released any water seeping down from the western rocky outcrop and accumulating beneath room 24. There is another drain with a similar function towards the north end of the western stylobate, which released water into the courtyard across a shallow channel, but it did not continue across the courtyard floor. The courtyard floor itself consisted of a few centimeters of a very hard packed mixture of clay and gritty limestone over bedrock, creating a particularly hard surface. The floor of the colonnade was similarly constituted. As flagstones have manifestly been robbed elsewhere in the building, it is possible that the whole area was once paved over this prepared surface.
A stylobate was laid on the four sides of this courtyard on leveled bedrock using ashlar blocks with neatly drafted edges (av. dimensions: 0.860 m x 0.680 m and 0.210~0.260 m deep, but there is considerable variation) with some rustication visible on the courtyard side below the courtyard floor level (fig. 7 details of stylobate). The colonnade is decastyle, with ten columns to a side, 36 in total. A deep and unusually wide foundation trench was cut in front of the stylobate on the courtyard side—going down in places 0.97 m from paving level and being up to 0.82 m wide (fig. 8: excavated garden bed.) Normally one would expect such a trench to be filled with builders&#39; rubble and chippings, but in this case, it was filled with rich brown, nitrogenous soil (not the light grey wind-blown dust that has accumulated over time elsewhere at the site). It seems clear that a formal garden was installed around the inside perimeter of much of the courtyard, easily watered from the roof-water collection. Soil samples were taken but have yet to be analysed: there is no other sign of courtyard planting. As such, it constitutes the earliest recorded courtyard garden in a Greek building and it helps to explain the sudden appearance of such plantings in the courtyards of southern Italian houses such as at Pompeii in the second century BCE.

Location Batnae
Batnae/Markopolis (Pleiades)
Location Description The broad plain of Batanaea lay to the west of the uplands, known as Auranitis, in the Hauran, a basalt region that straddled the boundary between ancient Syria and Arabia. Batanaea was not a naturally well-watered area, but it did develop during the Roman period into a successful grain-producing settlement via a careful management of rainwater. The agriculture of the area, which included small enclosed gardens and plantations surrounding villages, depended on precipitation; a large cistern, or birket, commonly found throughout the Hauran and Batanaea, likely served the village and not irrigation purposes. Although the village was perhaps the most ubiquitous settlement type, there did exist some imperial and private estates, potentially with their own gardens.
Garden Imperial Residence at Batnae
Keywords Garden Description The Emperor Julian described the imperial residence in Batnae in Syria in one of his letters to Libanius in 363 CE (Epist. 58). According to him, Batnae was thickly wooded with groves of cypress trees. The palace located there hardly seemed grand, but its garden was worthy of praise; Julian (Epist. 58) compared it to the gardens of Alcinous and Laertes in Homer’s Odyssey. It contained a small grove of cypresses, as well as rows of such trees planted along the garden wall, and in the middle of the garden were vegetable beds and fruit trees of all sorts.

      <description>Province Syria
Location Antioch Antioch (Pleiades)
Location Description Antioch on the Orontes was founded by the Macedonian general Seleucus I as the capital of his Syrian empire, following the breakup of Alexander’s empire (ca. 300 BCE). He selected the site at the edge of the fertile Amuk Plain at the crossroads of important trade routes linking Syria with Palestine, the Mediterranean, and Asia Minor. Antioch was also the capital of the Roman province of Syria, annexed in 64 BCE. In the Augustan period Strabo (16.2.5) compares Antioch favorably to Alexandria in power and size. It was built along the banks of the River Orontes below the craggy heights of Mount Silpios. Because of its advantageous location, Antioch became a cultural, religious, and commercial center in the Roman period. The presence of an imperial residence, as well as buildings for the staging of athletic contests modeled after the Olympic Games, a sanctuary of Apollo, and thermal spa at Daphne, contributed to its renown in the ancient world.
Garden Private Houses at Antioch
Keywords  courtyards fountains mosaics (visual works) statues water features (landscaping)  Garden Description The most significant finds from the international excavations conducted from 1932 to 1939 were the many houses built in and around the city center, on the surrounding terraces of the mountain slopes, in the suburb of Daphne, and in the port of Seleucia Pieria. Scores of floor mosaics dating from the second to the sixth centuries CE paved these houses and brought the private lives of the elite into focus. Although no gardens have been excavated in Antioch, the examination of the figural mosaics, statuary, and the fragmentary remains of house plans suggest that there were private gardens.
During the hot summer months, the wealthy citizens of Antioch retired to Daphne, a settlement on a plateau overlooking the plain of Antioch about five miles south, for cooler breezes and its refreshing springs (Lib. Ep. 419). The suburb was admired for its “varied gardens and charming inns and an abundance of springs and houses hidden in trees and chambers which rise above the groves and luxurious baths…” (Lib. Or. 11.234). The excavations revealed the remains of houses that were richly decorated with mosaics, pools, and fountains. The fact that Daphne was the source for the water carried by two aqueducts to Antioch allowed for a generous use of water in private houses. As in Pompeii, pools and fountains seem to form the natural focal point of house designs. We turn to Libanius, a rhetorician from fourth century CE Antioch, for confirmation of the archaeological evidence: “One can judge the wealth of our waters by the number of the houses, since there are as many fountains as there are houses, or rather there are many fountains in each house” (Lib. Or. 11.246).
Unfortunately, the houses of Antioch were incompletely excavated and their state of preservation makes it difficult to distinguish the boundaries of individual houses or even the entrances into rooms. This leaves many questions, including the evidence for gardens, unanswered. The third century CE House of Menander at Daphne provides the most complete plan from Antioch, but it can only hint at the possibility of a garden (Fig. 1). The most typical feature of Antiochene houses is the sequential arrangement of the dining room, columned court, and fountain or pool (e.g., House of Menander, House of the Boat of the Psyches, House of the Drinking Contest). A similar alignment of spaces occurs in the House of Bacchus and Ariadne in Thuburbo Maius, modern Tunisia, where the diners could look out from two different dining rooms through a columned screen to a mosaic basin and beyond into a garden area (one is a peristyle garden; the other is a courtyard garden) where evidence of plantings was found. It would seem from such parallels, including the evidence of many excavated gardens in Pompeii, that plantings in the peristyles and courts were closely aligned with dining vistas and water features. One might reasonably conjecture that the courtyards and pseudo-peristyle areas with fountains and pools in the House of Menander at Daphne contained potted plants. As most of the areas of the excavated houses at Antioch were paved with mosaic, it seems less likely that there were open soil areas for plantings of evergreen trees as found in Pompeii, such as the House of Polybios. However, given the nearby topos of the cypress-filled grove of Daphne with its gurgling thermal springs and the original laurel bush (see Sacred Grove at Daphne), it is not difficult to imagine greenery inserted into the courtyards and areas accented by niched fountains and pools in the Antiochene houses.

The presence of an imperial residence, as well as buildings for the staging of athletic contests modeled after the Olympic Games, a sanctuary of Apollo, and thermal spa at Daphne, contributed to its renown in the ancient world.
Garden Sacred Grove at Daphne
Keywords  sacred groves  Garden Description Antioch was most famous for its public gardens, such as the sacred grove of Daphne in the precinct of Apollo. The sanctuary was described by Strabo as a “large, thickly shaded grove intersected by fountain streams in the midst of which there is an asylum precinct and a temple of Apollo and Artemis” (16.2.6). This impression is reinforced in the lecture given in 360 CE by Libanius who praises Daphne for “the number and thickness and height of the cypresses, the shady paths, the choruses of singing birds, the even breeze, the odors sweeter than spices, the stately aqueducts, the vines trained to form banqueting hall – these are the gardens of Alcinous…a veritable Sybaris” (Lib. Or. 11.236).
Of Hellenistic origin, the site was famous during the Roman period for its cypress (Cupressus sp.) grove (Libanius, Or. 11.234-243; Strabo, 16.2.6). There is art historical and textual evidence for the grove, but no archaeological excavations of the grove have been undertaken nor has the precinct been defined. According to Libanius, Seleucus dedicated Daphne to Apollo because he found one of the arrow heads that Apollo had shot off in anger after the transformation of Daphne into a laurel (Laurus nobilis) (Libanius, Or. 11.94-99). According to the myth, it was here that the eponymous nymph, daughter of Ge and river god Ladon, was pursued and overtaken by Apollo at which point she was transformed into the laurel (Greek daphne, Fig. 2). In his disappointment at losing the nymph, Apollo shot all of his arrows, among which was one with his name that fell into the earth. When Seleucus found this buried arrow, he honored the discovery by creating a sacred enclosure, planting a grove of cypress trees, and dedicating a temple of Apollo (Lib. Or. 11.94-99). The esteem in which the grove at Daphne was held is attested by Libanius who remarks that he will write the emperor himself when an official threatened to cut the cypresses (Lib. Or. I.262-3). Reportedly, Seleucus planted a cypress grove and constructed a temple at the site (Sozomen, Hist. eccl., 5.19). Malalas (204.9-16) writes that Herakles planted a cypress grove and that the Heraklia was located outside the grove near the temple of Athena. Philostratus, however, reports a different story about the grove: the Landon worshipped the laurel. A cypress grove surrounded the temple, and a single cypress sapling grew naturally in honor of Cyparissus, an Assyrian youth who also experienced a metamorphosis (Philostratus, V A, 1.16).
The purposeful evocation of a sacred landscape can be seen in the placement of the temple near the spring Castalia in which the oracle of Apollo was considered to reside. A representation of the journey from the springs of Daphne to Antioch along a tree-lined street is picturesquely depicted in the topographic border of the mosaic of Megalopsychia found in the mid-fifth century CE villa at Daphne (Yakto area) (Fig. 3). Water flows from a vase held by a nude female, identified by a Greek inscription as the personification “Kastalia,” into a semi-circular colonnaded nymphaeum. Another stream of water flows from her into a reservoir with another nymph identified as “Pallas,” but there is no sign of the sacred grove or the temple. In addition, the grove was the symbol for Daphne on a medieval copy of the Tabula Peutingeriana (4th century CE). Though archaeologists have not found any material traces of the revered grove at Daphne, there is archaeological evidence for the planting of groves at the Sanctuary of Apollo Hylates (“He of the woodlands”) in Kourion, Cyprus, and elsewhere (see: cross-references here).

Covering the substantial central part of the Fertile Crescent, the province of Syria sat in an advantageous position between the mountain ranges of eastern Anatolia, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Arabian deserts, and it served as an area of expansion for the larger kingdoms around it. Important trans-Asian trade routes made Syria a key component in the Roman imperial economy, and large navigable rivers, such as the Euphrates and the Orontes, were exploited to connect the Persian Gulf with northern cities. The climate, although arid in the inland mountainous areas, was quite conducive to cultivation. River valleys in the mountain chains skirting the coast provided fertile terrain for agriculture, and the Orontes and Euphrates created well-watered plateaus in the steppe and desert regions of the southeast.
An irrigation system based around the qanat, an underground water channel, was used in Syria during the Roman period to water fields and gardens. Although qanats were likely introduced to the region via the earlier Achaemenid Persian dynasty, it was during the Roman and Byzantine periods that irrigation technology improved, and the majority of known qanats date to this time. The water could flow from these channels into canals, small reservoirs known today as birkas, or large wells. The ancient field systems of Syria have been well studied in areas such as the Hauran, a basalt region in the south. Cereals, olives and grapes were important crops, and were cultivated in either the broad fields on the lowland plains, or long, segmented plots on terraces in the rocky highlands. These terraced plots would have held fruit trees or vineyards.

Garden Tomb garden at Tyre
Keywords  tombs basins (vessels) niches  Garden Description A tomb garden (Tomb Complex 15) has been found in a cemetery complex dating to the fourth century CE. (Fig. 1) Excavated by Maurice Chéhab, it features an enclosed garden (18x21 m) surrounded by a wall. The west wall supports a water channel which fed a rectangular basin in the apsidal hall and a large square basin in the northeast corner of the garden. (Fig. 2) A small square basin was installed by the great basin to catch the water and transmit it to channels in the garden itself. Along the central axis of the garden postholes were found, suggesting a free-standing trellis, or perhaps some form of fence. Other features of the walls include decorative niches, possibly for sculpture. No evidence for plants has been recovered, but from the structural arrangement, it is clearly a garden. Such tomb gardens provided a gracious place for visiting the dead and perhaps for growing produce for offerings and subsidizing the maintenance of the complex.
