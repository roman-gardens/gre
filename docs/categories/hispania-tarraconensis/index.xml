      <description>Province Hispania Tarraconensis
Tarraconensis(Pleiades)
Province Description In 236 BC, to offset Carthage&amp;rsquo;s loss of Sicily and Sardinia in the First Punic War, Hamilcar Barca led an expedition into Hispania to establish a colony there. Through force of arms and diplomacy, he spread Carthaginian influence as far north as Barcellona, which bears his name. In 230 BC, Hasdrubal, his son-in-law, established Qart Hadast that became Carthago Nova in Roman times and Cartagena today. After the death of Hasdrubal, Hannibal, Hamilcar&amp;rsquo;s oldest son, took command, attacked Saguntum, and in 218 set out for Italy leaving his younger brother, Hasdrubal, in command in Spain. Through the Alps, he descended into Italy and threatened Rome for fourteen years. Roman armies under the brothers Gnaeus and Publius Cornelius Scipio kept Hasdrubal in check and prevented his reinforcing Hannibal. They were both killed by the Carthaginians in 212. Two years later, another Publius Cornelius Scipio, the 25-year-old son of the late general of the same name, was sent to Spain. The next year, he captured New Carthage and, in 206 at the battle of Ilipa (about 15 km north of Savilla) destroyed most of the Carthaginians&amp;rsquo; numerically superior army and ended their hold on Spain. Scipio settled his wounded veterans nearby at a place he called Italica to remind them of their origins. Today, it is one of the best Roman archaeological sites in Italy. After a quick trip back to Rome, where he was elected consul, he returned to Spain and went on to attack Carthage itself. Hannibal was recalled to Africa, but Scipio annihilated his army in 202. Rome thus came into possession of the Mediterranean coast of Iberia.
If Rome was drawn into Hispania to keep the Carthaginians there from supporting Hannibal in Italy, it missed the opportunity offered by Hannibal&amp;rsquo;s defeat to get out of Spain honorably. Instead, in 197 BC it created two new Roman provinces, Hispania Citerior whose capital was Carthago Nova and Hispania Ulterior with Corduba as its capital. Soon after, Rome launched a long war to subjugate the Lusitani, Celtiberians on the west coast. During Sulla&amp;rsquo;s dictatorship, the Lusitani were again in revolt, this time under the able leadership of the Roman general Quintus Sertorius, who sought to create an independent, Roman-like state in Hispania. He established a senate and schools for the sons of the local nobility.
Augustus&amp;rsquo;s conquest of Hispania produced a new territorial division that replaced the earlier two-province organization of the region. Augustus divided the whole of the peninsula into three provinces: Hispania Citerior or Tarraconensis, with its capital Tarraco (Tarragona); Hispania Ulterior Baetica, with its capital Corduba (Córdoba); and Hispania Ulterior Lusitania, or Emerita Augusta, with its capital Mérida. The provinces, in turn, were subdivided in administrative legal units, or conventus. The western lands stayed part of the newly demarcated Lusitania, areas into which Romanization had hardly penetrated, in contrast to the other areas of the peninsula where the classical tradition had been incorporated quite early. This division lasted until late antiquity, when Tarraconensis was subdivided into three provinces: Tarraconensis, whose capital continued to be Tarraco (Tarragona), Carthaginiensis, with Carthago Nova (Catagena) as its capital, and Gallaecia, whose capital was Bracara Augusta (Braga, in northern Portugal).
The Mediterranean trio of wine, oil and cereals are the crops most frequently mentioned by all the classical authors when referring to the Iberian Peninsula. These were not the only plants cultivated here. Trogus Pompey, in his Universal History (44. 1-2), praises, as well as those products, the fertility of the soil itself, the benevolence of its climate, the opportune and abundant rains which enable all types of fruits to be gathered, thus supplying every need. He describes the linen and esparto grass as of the highest quality. Strabo recorded the tradition of irrigation as a common practice in pre-Roman agriculture (Strabo 3.2.5). This was continued by the Romans, as shown by the number of aqueducts, dams and small reservoirs still to be found on Spanish soil. Pliny, during his stay as procurator in Spain in the first century, gives more specific descriptions of the flora throughout his Natural History (Book XVI). Martial (Epigrams II) refers to myrtle, box and laurel, as common elements to be found in the garden of country houses in Spain.
It is not strange, therefore, that gardening, the work of the topiarius, was usual in Iberian houses, as this study shows. It was not, however, totally new to Spanish territory. Although there are no literary references to gardening in the Pre-Roman era, it must have been part of Iberian culture, as is proved in an unusual way in the northwest of the peninsula in the area under the influence of Greek culture from the city of Emporion (Ampurias or Empuriae). A Hellenic establishment there, Rhode (Rosas), in the third century BC minted drachmas with a rose as the emblem. There were sacred woods connected with the cities. Close to Augustas Emeritas was Lucus Feroniae. Dedicated to Augustus was Lucus Augusti, which gave rise to the present-day Lugo, in Galicia, and another Lucus existed in the environs of Gijón, the Lugo de Llanera (Blázquez, p. 24).
There has been little research on the gardens in the Roman settlements in Spain and Portugal. In drawing up the list of sites with gardens for this catalog, we have accepted that a garden existed when it was so labeled by the excavators. There are, however, many other probable gardens which we have included. Gorges found just under forty villas where enough remained to draw a plan. In them, certain features help to identify a garden. A peristyle alerts us to suspect a garden, but peristyle courtyards were sometimes paved with stones or bricks over a layer of lime. They were clearly not gardens. But if the courtyard had soil in it, it was in all probability a garden. Fountains, fountain statues, and pools are typical of a garden since water is indispensable for a garden. Most peristyles in Roman villas in Spain had ornamental irrigation channels, semicircular pools, wells or pools that gave the impression of still water that, nevertheless, endowed the garden with a cool humidity that favored the cultivation of plants. In Spain, peristyles with drainage are found in the first and second centuries AD and are also common in the late Empire. Certain types of statuary intimately connected with vegetation and nature are found in gardens, such as divinities related to Bacchus and his circle. At Pompeii, Diana, a garden goddess, sometimes paired with Apollo, is also found. Herms were placed on pilasters, as the examples in situ from Pompeii show. Characteristic of Roman villas was the way in which they opened out to the countryside onto a grand vista of gardens and parks filled with fountains.
The roughly triangular province of Tarraconensis, by far the largest of the three provinces of the Iberian Peninsula, stretched across the north side of modern Spain and down the east coast as far as Almeria. On the Atlantic coast, it reached as far south as present Oporto.

  Location Emporiae
Emporiae (Pleiades)
Location Description As Strabo (3.4.8) tells us, Greeks from Phokaia, by way of Massalia (Marseilles), established a market town (Emporion) here. Archaeology gives a date of approximately 575- 550 BC. The original settlement was on an island in the mouth of the Fluvià River. About 550, the settlement began to spread south onto the mainland, and the original settlement became known as Palaiapolis, the Old City. For clarity, archaeologists have given this Greek settlement on the mainland the corresponding name of Neapolis, New City. The plural form of the Latin name for the area – Emporiae, “markets” – reflects the dual nature of the city. Though literary sources mention other Greek settlements along the coast of the Iberian Peninsula, this is the only one known archaeologically.
Not only was Emporion the point of first contact between the Celtoiberians and Hellenic civilization, it was also here that, in 218 B.C., Roman armies first entered Iberia. The Roman consul Publius Cornelius Scipio reached Massalia too late to intercept Hannibal on his march into Italy, so he dispatched his brother Cnaeus with part of his forces to Emporion to cut Hannibal&amp;rsquo;s supply lines, while he himself returned to engage the Carthaginian in the Po valley.
Neapolis was settled from north to south. The oldest parts date from before 550 BC. The oldest part of the city wall come from 450 – 425 BC. The Asklepion in the southwest corner was built in the 400 -350 BC period, as a reorganization of an older sanctuary. In the years 375 – 350 BC, a new wall extended farther south. The 2nd century BC saw major building programs. The wall was again extended southwards. A new agora was formed, and the Asklepion reorganized. Public baths were built in the northeastern part of the city about 100 BC. A Serapium was built in the southeastern corner in the first century B.C. Around 100 B.C., a Roman city surrounded by a wall (750 x 350 m) was built on a hill about 150 meters west of Neapolis where there had previously been a structure that was probably the Roman praesidium. We will refer to this area as the Roman City; it is also called the Republican City . Streets were laid out in a rectangular grid, and a large forum occupied the center of the southern half. Just outside the south wall were an amphitheater and a palaestra. Three large houses, two of them with gardens, have been found northeast of the forum and one to the southeast of it. The northern half of the city remains unexcavated. Once development of the Roman City began, Neapolis seems to have been little changed. The two walls between them were dismantled, but – rather strangely – replaced by a single wall, probably in connection with the creation of the Municipium Emporiae in about 36 – 27 B.C.
Neapolis was abandoned in the course of the second half of the first century AD. The Roman City seems to have ceased development at about that time but remained inhabited to nearly the end of the third century. This abandonment of a once-thriving trading town is probably connected with the silting up of the harbor. The mouth of the Fluvià River has shifted seven kilometers to the north, while Palaiapolis, once an island, is now a hill rising out of lowland where the harbor once was.
Publicly funded excavation of the northeastern part of Neapolis and the forum of the Roman City was conducted in 1846-8. Further systematic studies were conducted from 1908 to 1936 under E. Gandía, who took a great interest in stratigraphy before it was common to do so. The Spanish Civil War brought this work to an end, but Gandía&amp;rsquo;s day books have been preserved. Work was resumed in the 1940&amp;rsquo;s and 1950&amp;rsquo;s by M. Almagro, with recent work by R. Mar and J. Ruiz de Arbulo, and B. Tang. Tang emphasizes that it is often difficult or impossible to determine whether a space in a house in Neapolis was open or covered. The difficulty should not be so great in the case of gardens, for any sort of paving or hammered earth rules out the possibility of a garden. She identifies gardens in N5 and N7 and notes that also N 52 near the northern end of the western edge and N 75 on the northern edge “appear to have been provided with gardens or terraces.”

  Location Clunia
Clunia (Pleiades)
Location Description This settlement, dating from Julio-Claudian times, is on a high meseta some 60 meters above the surrounding plain and a hundred meters above the water in the Arandilla River. (The Celtoiberian settlement of Clunia, mentioned in the second century BC, seems to have been a short distance away on the other side of the Arandilla.) Clunia was made a Municipium in the reign of Tiberius, and later became a colony, Colonia Clunia Sulpicia. Beginning in the reign of Claudius and throughout the rest of the first and second centuries, it was the administrative capital of Hispania Tarraconensis. At this time, it was probably the largest Roman city in Iberia. The third century saw a decline and loss of the role of administrative center; there was a revival in the fourth century lasting to at least the middle of the fifth century, but it stopped short of a return to former prosperity. Depopulation followed in the sixth and seventh centuries, and the residents used the area as a necropolis.
It was identified as a Roman site by scholars in the 16th century. A plan published in 1788 shows that streets, squares, and walls were then still visible, but subsequent quarrying for stone destroyed the remains. Systematic excavations began in 1915-1916 and continued under the direction of Blas Taracena for several years following 1931 (when it was declared a national monument). After the interruption caused by the Spanish civil war, work was resumed in 1958 under the direction of Pedro de Palol.
The steep sides of the meseta and its height above the surrounding plain clearly made the site defensible, but at the same time posed a problem of water supply, especially for the gardens and extensive baths. Aqueducts were out of the question; elevated spans nearly twice the height of the Pont du Gard and many kilometers long would have been necessary. The solution lay in a series of natural caverns in the limestone which the Romans connected and dammed up with locks at the outlet at the northern end. These structures turned the whole meseta into a catch basin for water during the rainy season. They held some 1.5 million liters. The water level was about 15 meters below the ground level at the baths and about 20 meters below at House 1. Such a depth meant that it was worthwhile to catch water in cisterns near the surface, but the bottoms of some 15 conical wells into the caverns leave no doubt that the water was used in dry periods. The structures were identified in 1913 by Vicente Hinojal; further explored in 1976 and 1977 by Pedro de Palol; and then thoroughly explored and mapped beginning in 1981 by archaeologists in collaboration with the local speleological group. Further geophysical study was underway in 2004.

  Garden Arcos I Public Baths
Keywords  natationes caldaria  Garden Description These baths are remarkable for their size (55 x 95 m), symmetry, and inclusion of a large garden. At the back of the grand semicircular entrance hall opened the garden, formerly thought to have been a natatio. On either side then followed a palestra (Fig. 1, P), an apodyterium or changing room (A), a frigidarium (F), and a tepidarium (T). Only the caldarium (C) was shared between the sexes. The semicircular wall at the northeastern end of the garden area goes quite deep into the ground and was presumably part of a swimming pool. As late as 1994, de Palol thought that most of the central court had been a pool, but subsequent thorough investigation could not find evidence for it except near that wall. The oldest elements go back to Tiberian times as attested by ceramics near the base of the semicircular wall, constituting the oldest finds in Clunia. Two further datable extensions occurred in Flavian and Antonine times.

Province Description In 236 BC, to offset Carthage&amp;rsquo;s loss of Sicily and Sardinia in the First Punic War, Hamilcar Barca led an expedition into Hispania to establish a colony there. Through force of arms and diplomacy, he spread Carthaginian influence as far north as Barcellona, which bears his name. In 230 BC, Hasdrubal, his son-in-law, established Qart Hadast that became Carthago Nova in Roman times and Cartagena today. After the death of Hasdrubal, Hannibal, Hamilcar&amp;rsquo;s oldest son, took command, attacked Saguntum, and in 218 set out for Italy leaving his younger brother, Hasdrubal, in command in Spain. Through the Alps, he descended into Italy and threatened Rome for fourteen years. Roman armies under the brothers Gnaeus and Publius Cornelius Scipio kept Hasdrubal in check and prevented his reinforcing Hannibal. They were both killed by the Carthaginians in 212. Two years later, another Publius Cornelius Scipio, the 25-year-old son of the late general of the same name, was sent to Spain. The next year, he captured New Carthage and, in 206 at the battle of Ilipa (about 15 km north of Savilla) destroyed most of the Carthaginians&amp;rsquo; numerically superior army and ended their hold on Spain. Scipio settled his wounded veterans nearby at a place he called Italica to remind them of their origins. Today, it is one of the best Roman archaeological sites in Italy. After a quick trip back to Rome, where he was elected consul, he returned to Spain and went on to attack Carthage itself. Hannibal was recalled to Africa, but Scipio annihilated his army in 202. Rome thus came into possession of the Mediterranean coast of Iberia.
If Rome was drawn into Hispania to keep the Carthaginians there from supporting Hannibal in Italy, it missed the opportunity offered by Hannibal&amp;rsquo;s defeat to get out of Spain honorably. Instead, in 197 BC it created two new Roman provinces, Hispania Citerior whose capital was Carthago Nova and Hispania Ulterior with Corduba as its capital. Soon after, Rome launched a long war to subjugate the Lusitani, Celtiberians on the west coast. During Sulla&amp;rsquo;s dictatorship, the Lusitani were again in revolt, this time under the able leadership of the Roman general Quintus Sertorius, who sought to create an independent, Roman-like state in Hispania. He established a senate and schools for the sons of the local nobility.
Augustus&amp;rsquo;s conquest of Hispania produced a new territorial division that replaced the earlier two-province organization of the region. Augustus divided the whole of the peninsula into three provinces: Hispania Citerior or Tarraconensis, with its capital Tarraco (Tarragona); Hispania Ulterior Baetica, with its capital Corduba (Córdoba); and Hispania Ulterior Lusitania, or Emerita Augusta, with its capital Mérida. The provinces, in turn, were subdivided in administrative legal units, or conventus. The western lands stayed part of the newly demarcated Lusitania, areas into which Romanization had hardly penetrated, in contrast to the other areas of the peninsula where the classical tradition had been incorporated quite early. This division lasted until late antiquity, when Tarraconensis was subdivided into three provinces: Tarraconensis, whose capital continued to be Tarraco (Tarragona), Carthaginiensis, with Carthago Nova (Catagena) as its capital, and Gallaecia, whose capital was Bracara Augusta (Braga, in northern Portugal).
The Mediterranean trio of wine, oil and cereals are the crops most frequently mentioned by all the classical authors when referring to the Iberian Peninsula. These were not the only plants cultivated here. Trogus Pompey, in his Universal History (44. 1-2), praises, as well as those products, the fertility of the soil itself, the benevolence of its climate, the opportune and abundant rains which enable all types of fruits to be gathered, thus supplying every need. He describes the linen and esparto grass as of the highest quality. Strabo recorded the tradition of irrigation as a common practice in pre-Roman agriculture (Strabo 3.2.5). This was continued by the Romans, as shown by the number of aqueducts, dams and small reservoirs still to be found on Spanish soil. Pliny, during his stay as procurator in Spain in the first century, gives more specific descriptions of the flora throughout his Natural History (Book XVI). Martial (Epigrams II) refers to myrtle, box and laurel, as common elements to be found in the garden of country houses in Spain.
It is not strange, therefore, that gardening, the work of the topiarius, was usual in Iberian houses, as this study shows. It was not, however, totally new to Spanish territory. Although there are no literary references to gardening in the Pre-Roman era, it must have been part of Iberian culture, as is proved in an unusual way in the northwest of the peninsula in the area under the influence of Greek culture from the city of Emporion (Ampurias or Empuriae). A Hellenic establishment there, Rhode (Rosas), in the third century BC minted drachmas with a rose as the emblem. There were sacred woods connected with the cities. Close to Augustas Emeritas was Lucus Feroniae. Dedicated to Augustus was Lucus Augusti, which gave rise to the present-day Lugo, in Galicia, and another Lucus existed in the environs of Gijón, the Lugo de Llanera (Blázquez, p. 24).
There has been little research on the gardens in the Roman settlements in Spain and Portugal. In drawing up the list of sites with gardens for this catalog, we have accepted that a garden existed when it was so labeled by the excavators. There are, however, many other probable gardens which we have included. Gorges found just under forty villas where enough remained to draw a plan. In them, certain features help to identify a garden. A peristyle alerts us to suspect a garden, but peristyle courtyards were sometimes paved with stones or bricks over a layer of lime. They were clearly not gardens. But if the courtyard had soil in it, it was in all probability a garden. Fountains, fountain statues, and pools are typical of a garden since water is indispensable for a garden. Most peristyles in Roman villas in Spain had ornamental irrigation channels, semicircular pools, wells or pools that gave the impression of still water that, nevertheless, endowed the garden with a cool humidity that favored the cultivation of plants. In Spain, peristyles with drainage are found in the first and second centuries AD and are also common in the late Empire. Certain types of statuary intimately connected with vegetation and nature are found in gardens, such as divinities related to Bacchus and his circle. At Pompeii, Diana, a garden goddess, sometimes paired with Apollo, is also found. Herms were placed on pilasters, as the examples in situ from Pompeii show. Characteristic of Roman villas was the way in which they opened out to the countryside onto a grand vista of gardens and parks filled with fountains.
The roughly triangular province of Tarraconensis, by far the largest of the three provinces of the Iberian Peninsula, stretched across the north side of modern Spain and down the east coast as far as Almeria. On the Atlantic coast, it reached as far south as present Oporto.

  Location Clunia
Clunia (Pleiades)
Location Description This settlement, dating from Julio-Claudian times, is on a high meseta some 60 meters above the surrounding plain and a hundred meters above the water in the Arandilla River. (The Celtoiberian settlement of Clunia, mentioned in the second century BC, seems to have been a short distance away on the other side of the Arandilla.) Clunia was made a Municipium in the reign of Tiberius, and later became a colony, Colonia Clunia Sulpicia. Beginning in the reign of Claudius and throughout the rest of the first and second centuries, it was the administrative capital of Hispania Tarraconensis. At this time, it was probably the largest Roman city in Iberia. The third century saw a decline and loss of the role of administrative center; there was a revival in the fourth century lasting to at least the middle of the fifth century, but it stopped short of a return to former prosperity. Depopulation followed in the sixth and seventh centuries, and the residents used the area as a necropolis.
It was identified as a Roman site by scholars in the 16th century. A plan published in 1788 shows that streets, squares, and walls were then still visible, but subsequent quarrying for stone destroyed the remains. Systematic excavations began in 1915-1916 and continued under the direction of Blas Taracena for several years following 1931 (when it was declared a national monument). After the interruption caused by the Spanish civil war, work was resumed in 1958 under the direction of Pedro de Palol.
The steep sides of the meseta and its height above the surrounding plain clearly made the site defensible, but at the same time posed a problem of water supply, especially for the gardens and extensive baths. Aqueducts were out of the question; elevated spans nearly twice the height of the Pont du Gard and many kilometers long would have been necessary. The solution lay in a series of natural caverns in the limestone which the Romans connected and dammed up with locks at the outlet at the northern end. These structures turned the whole meseta into a catch basin for water during the rainy season. They held some 1.5 million liters. The water level was about 15 meters below the ground level at the baths and about 20 meters below at House 1. Such a depth meant that it was worthwhile to catch water in cisterns near the surface, but the bottoms of some 15 conical wells into the caverns leave no doubt that the water was used in dry periods. The structures were identified in 1913 by Vicente Hinojal; further explored in 1976 and 1977 by Pedro de Palol; and then thoroughly explored and mapped beginning in 1981 by archaeologists in collaboration with the local speleological group. Further geophysical study was underway in 2004.

  Garden House of Taracena
Keywords  passages courtyards  Garden Description Excavated by Blas Taracena between 1933 and 1935, this house is located to the northeast of the forum. The arrangement of its gardens is most unusual. At the center of the house lies not a courtyard but an almost square summer triclinium with a stunning geometric mosaic. On the four sides were passageways and, beyond them small gardens, forming a Greek cross of gardens. Taracena was able to detect the soil contours of the planting beds of these gardens. (Fig 2), Although the gardens have not been replanted, the contours are now no longer visible.
In each courtyard was a cistern or well. The eastern courtyard had served as the atrium of the first phase of the house. Most of the wall paintings and mosaics in the house may date to the second half of the second century. The passageways in the north courtyard were paved in the reign of Constantine. The peristyle courtyard [53] at the rear of the complex (the north side) was probably a garden.
On the southeast corner of the house was a curious structure placed more than a meter below street level possibly to protect it from the harsh weather of the meseta . There are elements of a sort of subterranean peristyle and atrium with high walls between the columns. There are also kitchen fireplaces and connection to a cryptoportico.

      <description>Province Hispania Tarraconensis
Tarraconensis(Pleiades)
Province Description In 236 BC, to offset Carthage&amp;rsquo;s loss of Sicily and Sardinia in the First Punic War, Hamilcar Barca led an expedition into Hispania to establish a colony there. Through force of arms and diplomacy, he spread Carthaginian influence as far north as Barcellona, which bears his name. In 230 BC, Hasdrubal, his son-in-law, established Qart Hadast that became Carthago Nova in Roman times and Cartagena today. After the death of Hasdrubal, Hannibal, Hamilcar&amp;rsquo;s oldest son, took command, attacked Saguntum, and in 218 set out for Italy leaving his younger brother, Hasdrubal, in command in Spain. Through the Alps, he descended into Italy and threatened Rome for fourteen years. Roman armies under the brothers Gnaeus and Publius Cornelius Scipio kept Hasdrubal in check and prevented his reinforcing Hannibal. They were both killed by the Carthaginians in 212. Two years later, another Publius Cornelius Scipio, the 25-year-old son of the late general of the same name, was sent to Spain. The next year, he captured New Carthage and, in 206 at the battle of Ilipa (about 15 km north of Savilla) destroyed most of the Carthaginians&amp;rsquo; numerically superior army and ended their hold on Spain. Scipio settled his wounded veterans nearby at a place he called Italica to remind them of their origins. Today, it is one of the best Roman archaeological sites in Italy. After a quick trip back to Rome, where he was elected consul, he returned to Spain and went on to attack Carthage itself. Hannibal was recalled to Africa, but Scipio annihilated his army in 202. Rome thus came into possession of the Mediterranean coast of Iberia.
If Rome was drawn into Hispania to keep the Carthaginians there from supporting Hannibal in Italy, it missed the opportunity offered by Hannibal&amp;rsquo;s defeat to get out of Spain honorably. Instead, in 197 BC it created two new Roman provinces, Hispania Citerior whose capital was Carthago Nova and Hispania Ulterior with Corduba as its capital. Soon after, Rome launched a long war to subjugate the Lusitani, Celtiberians on the west coast. During Sulla&amp;rsquo;s dictatorship, the Lusitani were again in revolt, this time under the able leadership of the Roman general Quintus Sertorius, who sought to create an independent, Roman-like state in Hispania. He established a senate and schools for the sons of the local nobility.
Augustus&amp;rsquo;s conquest of Hispania produced a new territorial division that replaced the earlier two-province organization of the region. Augustus divided the whole of the peninsula into three provinces: Hispania Citerior or Tarraconensis, with its capital Tarraco (Tarragona); Hispania Ulterior Baetica, with its capital Corduba (Córdoba); and Hispania Ulterior Lusitania, or Emerita Augusta, with its capital Mérida.

  Location Emporiae
Emporiae (Pleiades)
Location Description As Strabo (3.4.8) tells us, Greeks from Phokaia, by way of Massalia (Marseilles), established a market town (Emporion) here. Archaeology gives a date of approximately 575- 550 BC. The original settlement was on an island in the mouth of the Fluvià River. About 550, the settlement began to spread south onto the mainland, and the original settlement became known as Palaiapolis, the Old City. For clarity, archaeologists have given this Greek settlement on the mainland the corresponding name of Neapolis, New City. The plural form of the Latin name for the area – Emporiae, “markets” – reflects the dual nature of the city. Though literary sources mention other Greek settlements along the coast of the Iberian Peninsula, this is the only one known archaeologically.
Not only was Emporion the point of first contact between the Celtoiberians and Hellenic civilization, it was also here that, in 218 B.C., Roman armies first entered Iberia. The Roman consul Publius Cornelius Scipio reached Massalia too late to intercept Hannibal on his march into Italy, so he dispatched his brother Cnaeus with part of his forces to Emporion to cut Hannibal&amp;rsquo;s supply lines, while he himself returned to engage the Carthaginian in the Po valley.
Neapolis was settled from north to south. The oldest parts date from before 550 BC. The oldest part of the city wall come from 450 – 425 BC. The Asklepion in the southwest corner was built in the 400 -350 BC period, as a reorganization of an older sanctuary. In the years 375 – 350 BC, a new wall extended farther south. The 2nd century BC saw major building programs. The wall was again extended southwards. A new agora was formed, and the Asklepion reorganized. Public baths were built in the northeastern part of the city about 100 BC. A Serapium was built in the southeastern corner in the first century B.C. Around 100 B.C., a Roman city surrounded by a wall (750 x 350 m) was built on a hill about 150 meters west of Neapolis where there had previously been a structure that was probably the Roman praesidium. We will refer to this area as the Roman City; it is also called the Republican City . Streets were laid out in a rectangular grid, and a large forum occupied the center of the southern half. Just outside the south wall were an amphitheater and a palaestra. Three large houses, two of them with gardens, have been found northeast of the forum and one to the southeast of it. The northern half of the city remains unexcavated. Once development of the Roman City began, Neapolis seems to have been little changed. The two walls between them were dismantled, but – rather strangely – replaced by a single wall, probably in connection with the creation of the Municipium Emporiae in about 36 – 27 B.C.
Neapolis was abandoned in the course of the second half of the first century AD. The Roman City seems to have ceased development at about that time but remained inhabited to nearly the end of the third century. This abandonment of a once-thriving trading town is probably connected with the silting up of the harbor. The mouth of the Fluvià River has shifted seven kilometers to the north, while Palaiapolis, once an island, is now a hill rising out of lowland where the harbor once was.
Publicly funded excavation of the northeastern part of Neapolis and the forum of the Roman City was conducted in 1846-8. Further systematic studies were conducted from 1908 to 1936 under E. Gandía, who took a great interest in stratigraphy before it was common to do so. The Spanish Civil War brought this work to an end, but Gandía&amp;rsquo;s day books have been preserved. Work was resumed in the 1940&amp;rsquo;s and 1950&amp;rsquo;s by M. Almagro, with recent work by R. Mar and J. Ruiz de Arbulo, and B. Tang. Tang emphasizes that it is often difficult or impossible to determine whether a space in a house in Neapolis was open or covered. The difficulty should not be so great in the case of gardens, for any sort of paving or hammered earth rules out the possibility of a garden. She identifies gardens in N5 and N7 and notes that also N 52 near the northern end of the western edge and N 75 on the northern edge “appear to have been provided with gardens or terraces.”

In Spain, peristyles with drainage are found in the first and second centuries AD and are also common in the late Empire. Certain types of statuary intimately connected with vegetation and nature are found in gardens, such as divinities related to Bacchus and his circle. At Pompeii, Diana, a garden goddess, sometimes paired with Apollo, is also found. Herms were placed on pilasters, as the examples in situ from Pompeii show. Characteristic of Roman villas was the way in which they opened out to the countryside onto a grand vista of gardens and parks filled with fountains.
The roughly triangular province of Tarraconensis, by far the largest of the three provinces of the Iberian Peninsula, stretched across the north side of modern Spain and down the east coast as far as Almeria. On the Atlantic coast, it reached as far south as present Oporto.

  Location Emporiae
Emporiae (Pleiades)
Location Description As Strabo (3.4.8) tells us, Greeks from Phokaia, by way of Massalia (Marseilles), established a market town (Emporion) here. Archaeology gives a date of approximately 575- 550 BC. The original settlement was on an island in the mouth of the Fluvià River. About 550, the settlement began to spread south onto the mainland, and the original settlement became known as Palaiapolis, the Old City. For clarity, archaeologists have given this Greek settlement on the mainland the corresponding name of Neapolis, New City. The plural form of the Latin name for the area – Emporiae, “markets” – reflects the dual nature of the city. Though literary sources mention other Greek settlements along the coast of the Iberian Peninsula, this is the only one known archaeologically.
Not only was Emporion the point of first contact between the Celtoiberians and Hellenic civilization, it was also here that, in 218 B.C., Roman armies first entered Iberia. The Roman consul Publius Cornelius Scipio reached Massalia too late to intercept Hannibal on his march into Italy, so he dispatched his brother Cnaeus with part of his forces to Emporion to cut Hannibal&amp;rsquo;s supply lines, while he himself returned to engage the Carthaginian in the Po valley.
Neapolis was settled from north to south. The oldest parts date from before 550 BC. The oldest part of the city wall come from 450 – 425 BC. The Asklepion in the southwest corner was built in the 400 -350 BC period, as a reorganization of an older sanctuary. In the years 375 – 350 BC, a new wall extended farther south. The 2nd century BC saw major building programs. The wall was again extended southwards. A new agora was formed, and the Asklepion reorganized. Public baths were built in the northeastern part of the city about 100 BC. A Serapium was built in the southeastern corner in the first century B.C. Around 100 B.C., a Roman city surrounded by a wall (750 x 350 m) was built on a hill about 150 meters west of Neapolis where there had previously been a structure that was probably the Roman praesidium. We will refer to this area as the Roman City; it is also called the Republican City . Streets were laid out in a rectangular grid, and a large forum occupied the center of the southern half. Just outside the south wall were an amphitheater and a palaestra. Three large houses, two of them with gardens, have been found northeast of the forum and one to the southeast of it. The northern half of the city remains unexcavated. Once development of the Roman City began, Neapolis seems to have been little changed. The two walls between them were dismantled, but – rather strangely – replaced by a single wall, probably in connection with the creation of the Municipium Emporiae in about 36 – 27 B.C.
Neapolis was abandoned in the course of the second half of the first century AD. The Roman City seems to have ceased development at about that time but remained inhabited to nearly the end of the third century. This abandonment of a once-thriving trading town is probably connected with the silting up of the harbor. The mouth of the Fluvià River has shifted seven kilometers to the north, while Palaiapolis, once an island, is now a hill rising out of lowland where the harbor once was.
Publicly funded excavation of the northeastern part of Neapolis and the forum of the Roman City was conducted in 1846-8. Further systematic studies were conducted from 1908 to 1936 under E. Gandía, who took a great interest in stratigraphy before it was common to do so. The Spanish Civil War brought this work to an end, but Gandía&amp;rsquo;s day books have been preserved. Work was resumed in the 1940&amp;rsquo;s and 1950&amp;rsquo;s by M. Almagro, with recent work by R. Mar and J. Ruiz de Arbulo, and B. Tang. Tang emphasizes that it is often difficult or impossible to determine whether a space in a house in Neapolis was open or covered. The difficulty should not be so great in the case of gardens, for any sort of paving or hammered earth rules out the possibility of a garden. She identifies gardens in N5 and N7 and notes that also N 52 near the northern end of the western edge and N 75 on the northern edge “appear to have been provided with gardens or terraces.”

      <description>Province Hispania Tarraconensis
Tarraconensis(Pleiades)
Province Description In 236 BC, to offset Carthage&amp;rsquo;s loss of Sicily and Sardinia in the First Punic War, Hamilcar Barca led an expedition into Hispania to establish a colony there. Through force of arms and diplomacy, he spread Carthaginian influence as far north as Barcellona, which bears his name. In 230 BC, Hasdrubal, his son-in-law, established Qart Hadast that became Carthago Nova in Roman times and Cartagena today. After the death of Hasdrubal, Hannibal, Hamilcar&amp;rsquo;s oldest son, took command, attacked Saguntum, and in 218 set out for Italy leaving his younger brother, Hasdrubal, in command in Spain. Through the Alps, he descended into Italy and threatened Rome for fourteen years. Roman armies under the brothers Gnaeus and Publius Cornelius Scipio kept Hasdrubal in check and prevented his reinforcing Hannibal. They were both killed by the Carthaginians in 212. Two years later, another Publius Cornelius Scipio, the 25-year-old son of the late general of the same name, was sent to Spain. The next year, he captured New Carthage and, in 206 at the battle of Ilipa (about 15 km north of Savilla) destroyed most of the Carthaginians&amp;rsquo; numerically superior army and ended their hold on Spain. Scipio settled his wounded veterans nearby at a place he called Italica to remind them of their origins. Today, it is one of the best Roman archaeological sites in Italy. After a quick trip back to Rome, where he was elected consul, he returned to Spain and went on to attack Carthage itself. Hannibal was recalled to Africa, but Scipio annihilated his army in 202. Rome thus came into possession of the Mediterranean coast of Iberia.
If Rome was drawn into Hispania to keep the Carthaginians there from supporting Hannibal in Italy, it missed the opportunity offered by Hannibal&amp;rsquo;s defeat to get out of Spain honorably. Instead, in 197 BC it created two new Roman provinces, Hispania Citerior whose capital was Carthago Nova and Hispania Ulterior with Corduba as its capital. Soon after, Rome launched a long war to subjugate the Lusitani, Celtiberians on the west coast. During Sulla&amp;rsquo;s dictatorship, the Lusitani were again in revolt, this time under the able leadership of the Roman general Quintus Sertorius, who sought to create an independent, Roman-like state in Hispania. He established a senate and schools for the sons of the local nobility.
Augustus&amp;rsquo;s conquest of Hispania produced a new territorial division that replaced the earlier two-province organization of the region. Augustus divided the whole of the peninsula into three provinces: Hispania Citerior or Tarraconensis, with its capital Tarraco (Tarragona); Hispania Ulterior Baetica, with its capital Corduba (Córdoba); and Hispania Ulterior Lusitania, or Emerita Augusta, with its capital Mérida. The provinces, in turn, were subdivided in administrative legal units, or conventus. The western lands stayed part of the newly demarcated Lusitania, areas into which Romanization had hardly penetrated, in contrast to the other areas of the peninsula where the classical tradition had been incorporated quite early. This division lasted until late antiquity, when Tarraconensis was subdivided into three provinces: Tarraconensis, whose capital continued to be Tarraco (Tarragona), Carthaginiensis, with Carthago Nova (Catagena) as its capital, and Gallaecia, whose capital was Bracara Augusta (Braga, in northern Portugal).
The Mediterranean trio of wine, oil and cereals are the crops most frequently mentioned by all the classical authors when referring to the Iberian Peninsula. These were not the only plants cultivated here. Trogus Pompey, in his Universal History (44. 1-2), praises, as well as those products, the fertility of the soil itself, the benevolence of its climate, the opportune and abundant rains which enable all types of fruits to be gathered, thus supplying every need. He describes the linen and esparto grass as of the highest quality. Strabo recorded the tradition of irrigation as a common practice in pre-Roman agriculture (Strabo 3.2.5). This was continued by the Romans, as shown by the number of aqueducts, dams and small reservoirs still to be found on Spanish soil. Pliny, during his stay as procurator in Spain in the first century, gives more specific descriptions of the flora throughout his Natural History (Book XVI). Martial (Epigrams II) refers to myrtle, box and laurel, as common elements to be found in the garden of country houses in Spain.
It is not strange, therefore, that gardening, the work of the topiarius, was usual in Iberian houses, as this study shows. It was not, however, totally new to Spanish territory. Although there are no literary references to gardening in the Pre-Roman era, it must have been part of Iberian culture, as is proved in an unusual way in the northwest of the peninsula in the area under the influence of Greek culture from the city of Emporion (Ampurias or Empuriae). A Hellenic establishment there, Rhode (Rosas), in the third century BC minted drachmas with a rose as the emblem. There were sacred woods connected with the cities. Close to Augustas Emeritas was Lucus Feroniae. Dedicated to Augustus was Lucus Augusti, which gave rise to the present-day Lugo, in Galicia, and another Lucus existed in the environs of Gijón, the Lugo de Llanera (Blázquez, p. 24).
There has been little research on the gardens in the Roman settlements in Spain and Portugal. In drawing up the list of sites with gardens for this catalog, we have accepted that a garden existed when it was so labeled by the excavators. There are, however, many other probable gardens which we have included. Gorges found just under forty villas where enough remained to draw a plan. In them, certain features help to identify a garden. A peristyle alerts us to suspect a garden, but peristyle courtyards were sometimes paved with stones or bricks over a layer of lime. They were clearly not gardens. But if the courtyard had soil in it, it was in all probability a garden. Fountains, fountain statues, and pools are typical of a garden since water is indispensable for a garden. Most peristyles in Roman villas in Spain had ornamental irrigation channels, semicircular pools, wells or pools that gave the impression of still water that, nevertheless, endowed the garden with a cool humidity that favored the cultivation of plants. In Spain, peristyles with drainage are found in the first and second centuries AD and are also common in the late Empire. Certain types of statuary intimately connected with vegetation and nature are found in gardens, such as divinities related to Bacchus and his circle. At Pompeii, Diana, a garden goddess, sometimes paired with Apollo, is also found. Herms were placed on pilasters, as the examples in situ from Pompeii show. Characteristic of Roman villas was the way in which they opened out to the countryside onto a grand vista of gardens and parks filled with fountains.

Keywords  atriums porticoes  Garden Description House R2, situated south of House R1 in the area of the forum of the Roman City (Fig. 1), is of totally different design and is smaller, but equally luxurious. In describing the phases of its construction, we follow Tang&amp;rsquo;s account (page 126). (Fig. 2) In its first phase, from the first quarter of the 1st century BC, the area of House R2 was occupied by two separate, similar houses, designated R2A on the south and R2B on the north. Each had a single, central atrium, which opened onto the cardo along the west side. Behind each house, a hortus extended back and was bounded by an intervallum of the city wall. In the second phase, in the second third of the 1st century BC, house R2A expanded, absorbing its own hortus and that of its neighbor, and taking out part of the city wall and extending beyond it to the east. It also acquired the southeastern corner (room [15]) of its neighbor. The old hortus of R2A was replaced by a large garden of 400 square meters enclosed by a peristyle; and a suite of rooms, opening onto the garden, was added. on the east on land formerly outside the city wall. Moreover, a row of rooms [42 – 49] was built behind them and opening to the east. The area beyond them may have been a garden. In the the first century AD, in a third phase, the former hortus of House R2B was converted into a peristyle garden [35a] with porticoes on the east, south and west sides. Along the north side were three, precisely symmetric rooms. The south wall of the central one extended in an arc into the garden. This part of the wall probably had windows opening into the garden. Along the west side of the new peristyle garden a bath complex [30 – 32] was added. A fourth phase at the end of the 1st or beginning of the 2nd second century AD saw a reworking of the eastern side of the house, with a huge room [46] with a triple entrance from the wide portico which now ran along the east side. A large garden extended on to the east a distance not yet determined. The L-shaped portico next to the garden indicated an interest in protecting the garden from the north wind. A small altar with paintings of a serpent and cock was found in the house, possibly in the garden peristyle.

There are, however, many other probable gardens which we have included. Gorges found just under forty villas where enough remained to draw a plan. In them, certain features help to identify a garden. A peristyle alerts us to suspect a garden, but peristyle courtyards were sometimes paved with stones or bricks over a layer of lime. They were clearly not gardens. But if the courtyard had soil in it, it was in all probability a garden. Fountains, fountain statues, and pools are typical of a garden since water is indispensable for a garden. Most peristyles in Roman villas in Spain had ornamental irrigation channels, semicircular pools, wells or pools that gave the impression of still water that, nevertheless, endowed the garden with a cool humidity that favored the cultivation of plants. In Spain, peristyles with drainage are found in the first and second centuries AD and are also common in the late Empire. Certain types of statuary intimately connected with vegetation and nature are found in gardens, such as divinities related to Bacchus and his circle. At Pompeii, Diana, a garden goddess, sometimes paired with Apollo, is also found. Herms were placed on pilasters, as the examples in situ from Pompeii show. Characteristic of Roman villas was the way in which they opened out to the countryside onto a grand vista of gardens and parks filled with fountains.
The roughly triangular province of Tarraconensis, by far the largest of the three provinces of the Iberian Peninsula, stretched across the north side of modern Spain and down the east coast as far as Almeria. On the Atlantic coast, it reached as far south as present Oporto.

  Location Emporiae
Emporiae (Pleiades)
Location Description As Strabo (3.4.8) tells us, Greeks from Phokaia, by way of Massalia (Marseilles), established a market town (Emporion) here. Archaeology gives a date of approximately 575- 550 BC. The original settlement was on an island in the mouth of the Fluvià River. About 550, the settlement began to spread south onto the mainland, and the original settlement became known as Palaiapolis, the Old City. For clarity, archaeologists have given this Greek settlement on the mainland the corresponding name of Neapolis, New City. The plural form of the Latin name for the area – Emporiae, “markets” – reflects the dual nature of the city. Though literary sources mention other Greek settlements along the coast of the Iberian Peninsula, this is the only one known archaeologically.
Not only was Emporion the point of first contact between the Celtoiberians and Hellenic civilization, it was also here that, in 218 B.C., Roman armies first entered Iberia. The Roman consul Publius Cornelius Scipio reached Massalia too late to intercept Hannibal on his march into Italy, so he dispatched his brother Cnaeus with part of his forces to Emporion to cut Hannibal&amp;rsquo;s supply lines, while he himself returned to engage the Carthaginian in the Po valley.
Neapolis was settled from north to south. The oldest parts date from before 550 BC. The oldest part of the city wall come from 450 – 425 BC. The Asklepion in the southwest corner was built in the 400 -350 BC period, as a reorganization of an older sanctuary. In the years 375 – 350 BC, a new wall extended farther south. The 2nd century BC saw major building programs. The wall was again extended southwards. A new agora was formed, and the Asklepion reorganized. Public baths were built in the northeastern part of the city about 100 BC. A Serapium was built in the southeastern corner in the first century B.C. Around 100 B.C., a Roman city surrounded by a wall (750 x 350 m) was built on a hill about 150 meters west of Neapolis where there had previously been a structure that was probably the Roman praesidium. We will refer to this area as the Roman City; it is also called the Republican City . Streets were laid out in a rectangular grid, and a large forum occupied the center of the southern half. Just outside the south wall were an amphitheater and a palaestra. Three large houses, two of them with gardens, have been found northeast of the forum and one to the southeast of it. The northern half of the city remains unexcavated. Once development of the Roman City began, Neapolis seems to have been little changed. The two walls between them were dismantled, but – rather strangely – replaced by a single wall, probably in connection with the creation of the Municipium Emporiae in about 36 – 27 B.C.
Neapolis was abandoned in the course of the second half of the first century AD. The Roman City seems to have ceased development at about that time but remained inhabited to nearly the end of the third century. This abandonment of a once-thriving trading town is probably connected with the silting up of the harbor. The mouth of the Fluvià River has shifted seven kilometers to the north, while Palaiapolis, once an island, is now a hill rising out of lowland where the harbor once was.
Publicly funded excavation of the northeastern part of Neapolis and the forum of the Roman City was conducted in 1846-8. Further systematic studies were conducted from 1908 to 1936 under E. Gandía, who took a great interest in stratigraphy before it was common to do so. The Spanish Civil War brought this work to an end, but Gandía&amp;rsquo;s day books have been preserved. Work was resumed in the 1940&amp;rsquo;s and 1950&amp;rsquo;s by M. Almagro, with recent work by R. Mar and J. Ruiz de Arbulo, and B. Tang. Tang emphasizes that it is often difficult or impossible to determine whether a space in a house in Neapolis was open or covered. The difficulty should not be so great in the case of gardens, for any sort of paving or hammered earth rules out the possibility of a garden. She identifies gardens in N5 and N7 and notes that also N 52 near the northern end of the western edge and N 75 on the northern edge “appear to have been provided with gardens or terraces.”

Keywords  atrium houses city walls  Garden Description These two adjacent houses are typical Tuscan atrium houses, both are against the western city wall, and both have gardens of some 50 square meters at the back of the house (Fig. 1). In Pompeii, Jashemski found many small, non-peristyle gardens in modest homes. Few have been found elsewhere, probably because they were in cities and most ancient cities are under modern ones. This example of two side-by-side is therefore particularly noteworthy. Mar and R. de Arbulo, in their comprehensive volume on Emporiae, give two somewhat different versions of House N5, one on page 366 and one on the foldout map in the pocket at the back of the book. The main differences, however, are in the interpretation of the walls and spaces on the inside of the house and do not affect the interpretation of the garden areas.

      <description>Province Hispania Tarraconensis
Tarraconensis(Pleiades)
Province Description In 236 BC, to offset Carthage&amp;rsquo;s loss of Sicily and Sardinia in the First Punic War, Hamilcar Barca led an expedition into Hispania to establish a colony there. Through force of arms and diplomacy, he spread Carthaginian influence as far north as Barcellona, which bears his name. In 230 BC, Hasdrubal, his son-in-law, established Qart Hadast that became Carthago Nova in Roman times and Cartagena today. After the death of Hasdrubal, Hannibal, Hamilcar&amp;rsquo;s oldest son, took command, attacked Saguntum, and in 218 set out for Italy leaving his younger brother, Hasdrubal, in command in Spain. Through the Alps, he descended into Italy and threatened Rome for fourteen years. Roman armies under the brothers Gnaeus and Publius Cornelius Scipio kept Hasdrubal in check and prevented his reinforcing Hannibal. They were both killed by the Carthaginians in 212. Two years later, another Publius Cornelius Scipio, the 25-year-old son of the late general of the same name, was sent to Spain. The next year, he captured New Carthage and, in 206 at the battle of Ilipa (about 15 km north of Savilla) destroyed most of the Carthaginians&amp;rsquo; numerically superior army and ended their hold on Spain. Scipio settled his wounded veterans nearby at a place he called Italica to remind them of their origins. Today, it is one of the best Roman archaeological sites in Italy. After a quick trip back to Rome, where he was elected consul, he returned to Spain and went on to attack Carthage itself. Hannibal was recalled to Africa, but Scipio annihilated his army in 202. Rome thus came into possession of the Mediterranean coast of Iberia.
If Rome was drawn into Hispania to keep the Carthaginians there from supporting Hannibal in Italy, it missed the opportunity offered by Hannibal&amp;rsquo;s defeat to get out of Spain honorably. Instead, in 197 BC it created two new Roman provinces, Hispania Citerior whose capital was Carthago Nova and Hispania Ulterior with Corduba as its capital. Soon after, Rome launched a long war to subjugate the Lusitani, Celtiberians on the west coast. During Sulla&amp;rsquo;s dictatorship, the Lusitani were again in revolt, this time under the able leadership of the Roman general Quintus Sertorius, who sought to create an independent, Roman-like state in Hispania. He established a senate and schools for the sons of the local nobility.
Augustus&amp;rsquo;s conquest of Hispania produced a new territorial division that replaced the earlier two-province organization of the region. Augustus divided the whole of the peninsula into three provinces: Hispania Citerior or Tarraconensis, with its capital Tarraco (Tarragona); Hispania Ulterior Baetica, with its capital Corduba (Córdoba); and Hispania Ulterior Lusitania, or Emerita Augusta, with its capital Mérida. The provinces, in turn, were subdivided in administrative legal units, or conventus. The western lands stayed part of the newly demarcated Lusitania, areas into which Romanization had hardly penetrated, in contrast to the other areas of the peninsula where the classical tradition had been incorporated quite early. This division lasted until late antiquity, when Tarraconensis was subdivided into three provinces: Tarraconensis, whose capital continued to be Tarraco (Tarragona), Carthaginiensis, with Carthago Nova (Catagena) as its capital, and Gallaecia, whose capital was Bracara Augusta (Braga, in northern Portugal).
The Mediterranean trio of wine, oil and cereals are the crops most frequently mentioned by all the classical authors when referring to the Iberian Peninsula. These were not the only plants cultivated here. Trogus Pompey, in his Universal History (44. 1-2), praises, as well as those products, the fertility of the soil itself, the benevolence of its climate, the opportune and abundant rains which enable all types of fruits to be gathered, thus supplying every need. He describes the linen and esparto grass as of the highest quality. Strabo recorded the tradition of irrigation as a common practice in pre-Roman agriculture (Strabo 3.2.5). This was continued by the Romans, as shown by the number of aqueducts, dams and small reservoirs still to be found on Spanish soil. Pliny, during his stay as procurator in Spain in the first century, gives more specific descriptions of the flora throughout his Natural History (Book XVI). Martial (Epigrams II) refers to myrtle, box and laurel, as common elements to be found in the garden of country houses in Spain.
It is not strange, therefore, that gardening, the work of the topiarius, was usual in Iberian houses, as this study shows. It was not, however, totally new to Spanish territory. Although there are no literary references to gardening in the Pre-Roman era, it must have been part of Iberian culture, as is proved in an unusual way in the northwest of the peninsula in the area under the influence of Greek culture from the city of Emporion (Ampurias or Empuriae). A Hellenic establishment there, Rhode (Rosas), in the third century BC minted drachmas with a rose as the emblem. There were sacred woods connected with the cities. Close to Augustas Emeritas was Lucus Feroniae. Dedicated to Augustus was Lucus Augusti, which gave rise to the present-day Lugo, in Galicia, and another Lucus existed in the environs of Gijón, the Lugo de Llanera (Blázquez, p. 24).
There has been little research on the gardens in the Roman settlements in Spain and Portugal. In drawing up the list of sites with gardens for this catalog, we have accepted that a garden existed when it was so labeled by the excavators. There are, however, many other probable gardens which we have included. Gorges found just under forty villas where enough remained to draw a plan. In them, certain features help to identify a garden.

  Location Villa Fortunatus
Villa Fortunatus (Pleiades)
Location Description Fraga sits astride the Cinca river about 86 kilometers northwest of Tarragona and 103 kilometers east of Zaragoza. About 15 kilometers downstream, the Cinca is joined by the Segre and after another 5 kilometers they join the Ebro, which flows into the Mediterranean about 70 kilometers south west of Tarragona.
Garden Villa of Fortunatus
Keywords  peristyle houses mosaic  Garden Description On the left bank of the Cinca about 5 km upstream (north) of Fraga, at the top of a steep bank, this villa sits some fifteen meters above the river below. At high water, the villa could have fairly easily floated its products to the sea. It had a view of the fertile plain on the right bank. The site has been known since at least 1893 and was excavated almost clandestinely between 1926 and 1936; no reports are known. The site was occupied from the Republican period, but a new atrium-style house was constructed in the second century. At the end of the third or beginning of the fourth century, a peristyle (20.5 x 17 m.) with a garden was added. In the center of the north side was a long, narrow, brick pool raised above ground level. On it were paintings of fish and aquatic plants. Both ends of the pool are semicircular. At the east end of the pool was a well, 12-14 meters deep, which provided water for the garden. The galleries surrounding the garden were all paved in mosaic. In the triclinium or reception room on the south side of the garden the mosaic, with floral designs and animals, bears in its border the name of builder written in two parts, FORTU and NATUS, separated by the Christian symbol of the crossed Χ and Ρ and the letters ω and α. Later, a palaeochristian chapel was installed and remained intact until the sixth century. (B?)

Tarraconensis(Pleiades)
Province Description In 236 BC, to offset Carthage&amp;rsquo;s loss of Sicily and Sardinia in the First Punic War, Hamilcar Barca led an expedition into Hispania to establish a colony there. Through force of arms and diplomacy, he spread Carthaginian influence as far north as Barcellona, which bears his name. In 230 BC, Hasdrubal, his son-in-law, established Qart Hadast that became Carthago Nova in Roman times and Cartagena today. After the death of Hasdrubal, Hannibal, Hamilcar&amp;rsquo;s oldest son, took command, attacked Saguntum, and in 218 set out for Italy leaving his younger brother, Hasdrubal, in command in Spain. Through the Alps, he descended into Italy and threatened Rome for fourteen years. Roman armies under the brothers Gnaeus and Publius Cornelius Scipio kept Hasdrubal in check and prevented his reinforcing Hannibal. They were both killed by the Carthaginians in 212. Two years later, another Publius Cornelius Scipio, the 25-year-old son of the late general of the same name, was sent to Spain. The next year, he captured New Carthage and, in 206 at the battle of Ilipa (about 15 km north of Savilla) destroyed most of the Carthaginians&amp;rsquo; numerically superior army and ended their hold on Spain. Scipio settled his wounded veterans nearby at a place he called Italica to remind them of their origins. Today, it is one of the best Roman archaeological sites in Italy. After a quick trip back to Rome, where he was elected consul, he returned to Spain and went on to attack Carthage itself. Hannibal was recalled to Africa, but Scipio annihilated his army in 202. Rome thus came into possession of the Mediterranean coast of Iberia.
If Rome was drawn into Hispania to keep the Carthaginians there from supporting Hannibal in Italy, it missed the opportunity offered by Hannibal&amp;rsquo;s defeat to get out of Spain honorably. Instead, in 197 BC it created two new Roman provinces, Hispania Citerior whose capital was Carthago Nova and Hispania Ulterior with Corduba as its capital. Soon after, Rome launched a long war to subjugate the Lusitani, Celtiberians on the west coast. During Sulla&amp;rsquo;s dictatorship, the Lusitani were again in revolt, this time under the able leadership of the Roman general Quintus Sertorius, who sought to create an independent, Roman-like state in Hispania. He established a senate and schools for the sons of the local nobility.
Augustus&amp;rsquo;s conquest of Hispania produced a new territorial division that replaced the earlier two-province organization of the region. Augustus divided the whole of the peninsula into three provinces: Hispania Citerior or Tarraconensis, with its capital Tarraco (Tarragona); Hispania Ulterior Baetica, with its capital Corduba (Córdoba); and Hispania Ulterior Lusitania, or Emerita Augusta, with its capital Mérida. The provinces, in turn, were subdivided in administrative legal units, or conventus. The western lands stayed part of the newly demarcated Lusitania, areas into which Romanization had hardly penetrated, in contrast to the other areas of the peninsula where the classical tradition had been incorporated quite early. This division lasted until late antiquity, when Tarraconensis was subdivided into three provinces: Tarraconensis, whose capital continued to be Tarraco (Tarragona), Carthaginiensis, with Carthago Nova (Catagena) as its capital, and Gallaecia, whose capital was Bracara Augusta (Braga, in northern Portugal).
The Mediterranean trio of wine, oil and cereals are the crops most frequently mentioned by all the classical authors when referring to the Iberian Peninsula. These were not the only plants cultivated here. Trogus Pompey, in his Universal History (44. 1-2), praises, as well as those products, the fertility of the soil itself, the benevolence of its climate, the opportune and abundant rains which enable all types of fruits to be gathered, thus supplying every need. He describes the linen and esparto grass as of the highest quality. Strabo recorded the tradition of irrigation as a common practice in pre-Roman agriculture (Strabo 3.2.5). This was continued by the Romans, as shown by the number of aqueducts, dams and small reservoirs still to be found on Spanish soil. Pliny, during his stay as procurator in Spain in the first century, gives more specific descriptions of the flora throughout his Natural History (Book XVI). Martial (Epigrams II) refers to myrtle, box and laurel, as common elements to be found in the garden of country houses in Spain.
It is not strange, therefore, that gardening, the work of the topiarius, was usual in Iberian houses, as this study shows. It was not, however, totally new to Spanish territory. Although there are no literary references to gardening in the Pre-Roman era, it must have been part of Iberian culture, as is proved in an unusual way in the northwest of the peninsula in the area under the influence of Greek culture from the city of Emporion (Ampurias or Empuriae). A Hellenic establishment there, Rhode (Rosas), in the third century BC minted drachmas with a rose as the emblem. There were sacred woods connected with the cities. Close to Augustas Emeritas was Lucus Feroniae. Dedicated to Augustus was Lucus Augusti, which gave rise to the present-day Lugo, in Galicia, and another Lucus existed in the environs of Gijón, the Lugo de Llanera (Blázquez, p. 24).
There has been little research on the gardens in the Roman settlements in Spain and Portugal. In drawing up the list of sites with gardens for this catalog, we have accepted that a garden existed when it was so labeled by the excavators. There are, however, many other probable gardens which we have included. Gorges found just under forty villas where enough remained to draw a plan. In them, certain features help to identify a garden. A peristyle alerts us to suspect a garden, but peristyle courtyards were sometimes paved with stones or bricks over a layer of lime. They were clearly not gardens. But if the courtyard had soil in it, it was in all probability a garden. Fountains, fountain statues, and pools are typical of a garden since water is indispensable for a garden. Most peristyles in Roman villas in Spain had ornamental irrigation channels, semicircular pools, wells or pools that gave the impression of still water that, nevertheless, endowed the garden with a cool humidity that favored the cultivation of plants. In Spain, peristyles with drainage are found in the first and second centuries AD and are also common in the late Empire. Certain types of statuary intimately connected with vegetation and nature are found in gardens, such as divinities related to Bacchus and his circle. At Pompeii, Diana, a garden goddess, sometimes paired with Apollo, is also found. Herms were placed on pilasters, as the examples in situ from Pompeii show. Characteristic of Roman villas was the way in which they opened out to the countryside onto a grand vista of gardens and parks filled with fountains.
The roughly triangular province of Tarraconensis, by far the largest of the three provinces of the Iberian Peninsula, stretched across the north side of modern Spain and down the east coast as far as Almeria. On the Atlantic coast, it reached as far south as present Oporto.

Garden Villa Romana
Keywords  catch basin drains peristyles  Garden Description This large villa, with both a pars urbana and a pars rustica is on the right (south) bank of the Irati river just below the Foz de Lumbier, a gorge cut by the river through a limestone hill.
The villa was discovered by chance in the course of agricultural work in 1921. A number of mosaics were immediately removed to the provincial museum in Pamplona. Systematic excavation was undertaken by Vázquez de Parga and Taracena in the summers between 1942 and 1947. Results were published by Taracena in 1949 and 1950.
It had a first phase dating perhaps from the end of the first century CE. Taracena believed it was destroyed by fire. Little is known of this early phase. A new villa was built in the first third of the 4th century. In addition to the elegant pars urbana there were extensive facilities for cereal, wine, and oil production. The entrance seems to have been from the south. After a short entrance came a long gallery with polychrome geometric mosaics extending along the south side of a garden with a large central pool. The pool was fed by rainwater from the roofs; an interesting spherical catch basin was found on the south edge of the garden. A drain led off to the east. A low wall ran around the garden. On the north side of the garden a wide passage led straight into the middle of the south portico of the central peristyle. All four porticoes were paved in mosaics. In 1949, Taracena offered a detailed description of the courtyard:
The peristyle is the organic center of the second residence. It measures 10.45 by 9.22 meters, and its date of construction can be determined because in the the course of firming up the low wall surrounding it was found a coin of Constantine. Moreover, in exploring the subsoil at a depth of 50 centimeters, the level corresponding to the first villa, another coin of the late empire was found. Together, they seem to confirm that the peristyle was built in the 4th century, possibly in its first third. Inside the peristyle, near the wall, was found a dolium and near the wall on the south side was a line of irregular stones which perhaps formed the border of a flower bed.
Even though there are no other remains of bed borders, trellis, or paths nor any trace of plantings which would help us to imagine the interior of the peristyle, we have to suppose it enlivened by some small garden, for a plain earth patio surrounded by mosaics would have been of no use for agricultural work. Moreover, we have found peristyles of these dimensions in Clunia with a strip of garden a meter wide running around the inside of the bounding wall and limited on the inside by bricks in the ground. This peristyle at Liedena, however has only a central well whose puteal is lost. The well is 90 centimeters in diameter, lined with small-stone ashlar laid rather irregularly without mortar. At 7.2 meters, it reaches groundwater. Blas Taracena Aguirre, 1949, p.16
The oecus or principal reception room is the room with an apse facing the southwest corner of the peristyle. It is one of the few rooms resting on foundations from the first villa. Adjacent to its south side is a rectangular area which may have had a garden in the center. Further south was a fairly large open area. Possibly it was a garden, but a palestra associated with the nearby baths seems more likely.

Keywords  peristyle porticoes columns  Garden Description Excavations in the late 1940s and 1950s brought to light the remains of an urban house. Among the structures identified was a peristyle. The presence of a fountain and the existence of a dividing screen, or pluteus, caused Balil to assert that the house must have contained gardens. Two porticos were identified, a larger one in which six columns were recovered (a) and a smaller one with two columns (b). In the center of the larger portico was an L-shaped nympheum or fountain. A lively mosaic in the southwest corner dates the house to the beginning of the second century. Each porticus may have contained a garden.

It is not strange, therefore, that gardening, the work of the topiarius, was usual in Iberian houses, as this study shows. It was not, however, totally new to Spanish territory. Although there are no literary references to gardening in the Pre-Roman era, it must have been part of Iberian culture, as is proved in an unusual way in the northwest of the peninsula in the area under the influence of Greek culture from the city of Emporion (Ampurias or Empuriae). A Hellenic establishment there, Rhode (Rosas), in the third century BC minted drachmas with a rose as the emblem. There were sacred woods connected with the cities. Close to Augustas Emeritas was Lucus Feroniae. Dedicated to Augustus was Lucus Augusti, which gave rise to the present-day Lugo, in Galicia, and another Lucus existed in the environs of Gijón, the Lugo de Llanera (Blázquez, p. 24).
There has been little research on the gardens in the Roman settlements in Spain and Portugal. In drawing up the list of sites with gardens for this catalog, we have accepted that a garden existed when it was so labeled by the excavators. There are, however, many other probable gardens which we have included. Gorges found just under forty villas where enough remained to draw a plan. In them, certain features help to identify a garden. A peristyle alerts us to suspect a garden, but peristyle courtyards were sometimes paved with stones or bricks over a layer of lime. They were clearly not gardens. But if the courtyard had soil in it, it was in all probability a garden. Fountains, fountain statues, and pools are typical of a garden since water is indispensable for a garden. Most peristyles in Roman villas in Spain had ornamental irrigation channels, semicircular pools, wells or pools that gave the impression of still water that, nevertheless, endowed the garden with a cool humidity that favored the cultivation of plants. In Spain, peristyles with drainage are found in the first and second centuries AD and are also common in the late Empire. Certain types of statuary intimately connected with vegetation and nature are found in gardens, such as divinities related to Bacchus and his circle. At Pompeii, Diana, a garden goddess, sometimes paired with Apollo, is also found. Herms were placed on pilasters, as the examples in situ from Pompeii show. Characteristic of Roman villas was the way in which they opened out to the countryside onto a grand vista of gardens and parks filled with fountains.
The roughly triangular province of Tarraconensis, by far the largest of the three provinces of the Iberian Peninsula, stretched across the north side of modern Spain and down the east coast as far as Almeria. On the Atlantic coast, it reached as far south as present Oporto.

Garden Description The villa dates from the first century BC to the third century AD when it was transformed into a bath complex. It was partially reclaimed as a villa in late Roman and Medieval times. The excavators identified one of the rooms as a garden (Fig. 1, a) because of a fountain at its south side; however, other scholars, such as Fernández Castro, doubt this identification.

      <description>Province Hispania Tarraconensis
Tarraconensis(Pleiades)
Province Description In 236 BC, to offset Carthage&amp;rsquo;s loss of Sicily and Sardinia in the First Punic War, Hamilcar Barca led an expedition into Hispania to establish a colony there. Through force of arms and diplomacy, he spread Carthaginian influence as far north as Barcellona, which bears his name. In 230 BC, Hasdrubal, his son-in-law, established Qart Hadast that became Carthago Nova in Roman times and Cartagena today. After the death of Hasdrubal, Hannibal, Hamilcar&amp;rsquo;s oldest son, took command, attacked Saguntum, and in 218 set out for Italy leaving his younger brother, Hasdrubal, in command in Spain. Through the Alps, he descended into Italy and threatened Rome for fourteen years. Roman armies under the brothers Gnaeus and Publius Cornelius Scipio kept Hasdrubal in check and prevented his reinforcing Hannibal. They were both killed by the Carthaginians in 212. Two years later, another Publius Cornelius Scipio, the 25-year-old son of the late general of the same name, was sent to Spain. The next year, he captured New Carthage and, in 206 at the battle of Ilipa (about 15 km north of Savilla) destroyed most of the Carthaginians&amp;rsquo; numerically superior army and ended their hold on Spain. Scipio settled his wounded veterans nearby at a place he called Italica to remind them of their origins. Today, it is one of the best Roman archaeological sites in Italy. After a quick trip back to Rome, where he was elected consul, he returned to Spain and went on to attack Carthage itself. Hannibal was recalled to Africa, but Scipio annihilated his army in 202. Rome thus came into possession of the Mediterranean coast of Iberia.
If Rome was drawn into Hispania to keep the Carthaginians there from supporting Hannibal in Italy, it missed the opportunity offered by Hannibal&amp;rsquo;s defeat to get out of Spain honorably. Instead, in 197 BC it created two new Roman provinces, Hispania Citerior whose capital was Carthago Nova and Hispania Ulterior with Corduba as its capital. Soon after, Rome launched a long war to subjugate the Lusitani, Celtiberians on the west coast. During Sulla&amp;rsquo;s dictatorship, the Lusitani were again in revolt, this time under the able leadership of the Roman general Quintus Sertorius, who sought to create an independent, Roman-like state in Hispania. He established a senate and schools for the sons of the local nobility.
Augustus&amp;rsquo;s conquest of Hispania produced a new territorial division that replaced the earlier two-province organization of the region. Augustus divided the whole of the peninsula into three provinces: Hispania Citerior or Tarraconensis, with its capital Tarraco (Tarragona); Hispania Ulterior Baetica, with its capital Corduba (Córdoba); and Hispania Ulterior Lusitania, or Emerita Augusta, with its capital Mérida. The provinces, in turn, were subdivided in administrative legal units, or conventus. The western lands stayed part of the newly demarcated Lusitania, areas into which Romanization had hardly penetrated, in contrast to the other areas of the peninsula where the classical tradition had been incorporated quite early. This division lasted until late antiquity, when Tarraconensis was subdivided into three provinces: Tarraconensis, whose capital continued to be Tarraco (Tarragona), Carthaginiensis, with Carthago Nova (Catagena) as its capital, and Gallaecia, whose capital was Bracara Augusta (Braga, in northern Portugal).
The Mediterranean trio of wine, oil and cereals are the crops most frequently mentioned by all the classical authors when referring to the Iberian Peninsula. These were not the only plants cultivated here. Trogus Pompey, in his Universal History (44. 1-2), praises, as well as those products, the fertility of the soil itself, the benevolence of its climate, the opportune and abundant rains which enable all types of fruits to be gathered, thus supplying every need. He describes the linen and esparto grass as of the highest quality. Strabo recorded the tradition of irrigation as a common practice in pre-Roman agriculture (Strabo 3.2.5). This was continued by the Romans, as shown by the number of aqueducts, dams and small reservoirs still to be found on Spanish soil. Pliny, during his stay as procurator in Spain in the first century, gives more specific descriptions of the flora throughout his Natural History (Book XVI). Martial (Epigrams II) refers to myrtle, box and laurel, as common elements to be found in the garden of country houses in Spain.

Keywords  peristyles  Garden Description Excavation in 1968 – 1972 at this site, which has been reburied, revealed over half the area of a large, fourth century villa, laid out around a central peristyle garden (31.2 x 28.8 m). The excavations exposed the western half of the site while samples and trenches established the broad outlines of the eastern half. The oecus on the north side had a good view of the garden. Directly across from it were double-horseshoe-shaped baths on the south. Though mosaics are few, other finds indicate that the villa saw an intense and brilliant use during the fourth century and into the fifth, when there are signs of remodelling. The villa was briefly abandoned in Visigoth times, the in the mid-3rd century used as a necropolis.

It did not, however, have a view of the garden but looked along the northeast gallery of the peristyle. That there was a garden is indicated by the presence of a pipe which crossed the northeast portico presumably to supply water for plants or a nymphaeum in the center of the peristyle.

Villa dels Munts (Pleiades)
Garden Villa of Santa Lucia
Keywords  porticoes  Garden Description This richly adorned pleasure villa by the sea was built early in the first century AD and continued in use into the fifth century. Its period of greatest splendor was between about 100 and 250 AD. It was pillaged and burned shortly after 268, dated by a hoard of coins found in the underground prison. The prison was equipped with stocks, presumably for punishment of slaves. The mansion was rebuilt and enlarged during the fourth century AD.
Across the front of the house on the side by the sea ran a portico [1] in a northwest-to-southeast direction to offer the best view. The garden lay between this portico and the sea. The excavator judged the area to be a garden, and his view is supported by several pools and perhaps a nymphaeum in the area. Also, at its southeast end, the portico turns and runs towards the sea. Opening onto this arm was a reception room with seven octagonal fountains arranged in a U. This room thus faced the garden and a pool rather than the sea. The portico was extended by a walkway and steps which defined the edge of the garden and led down the hill to a large bath complex added in the fourth-century rebuilding.

      <description>Province Hispania Tarraconensis
Tarraconensis(Pleiades)
Province Description In 236 BC, to offset Carthage&amp;rsquo;s loss of Sicily and Sardinia in the First Punic War, Hamilcar Barca led an expedition into Hispania to establish a colony there. Through force of arms and diplomacy, he spread Carthaginian influence as far north as Barcellona, which bears his name. In 230 BC, Hasdrubal, his son-in-law, established Qart Hadast that became Carthago Nova in Roman times and Cartagena today. After the death of Hasdrubal, Hannibal, Hamilcar&amp;rsquo;s oldest son, took command, attacked Saguntum, and in 218 set out for Italy leaving his younger brother, Hasdrubal, in command in Spain. Through the Alps, he descended into Italy and threatened Rome for fourteen years. Roman armies under the brothers Gnaeus and Publius Cornelius Scipio kept Hasdrubal in check and prevented his reinforcing Hannibal. They were both killed by the Carthaginians in 212. Two years later, another Publius Cornelius Scipio, the 25-year-old son of the late general of the same name, was sent to Spain. The next year, he captured New Carthage and, in 206 at the battle of Ilipa (about 15 km north of Savilla) destroyed most of the Carthaginians&amp;rsquo; numerically superior army and ended their hold on Spain. Scipio settled his wounded veterans nearby at a place he called Italica to remind them of their origins. Today, it is one of the best Roman archaeological sites in Italy. After a quick trip back to Rome, where he was elected consul, he returned to Spain and went on to attack Carthage itself. Hannibal was recalled to Africa, but Scipio annihilated his army in 202. Rome thus came into possession of the Mediterranean coast of Iberia.
If Rome was drawn into Hispania to keep the Carthaginians there from supporting Hannibal in Italy, it missed the opportunity offered by Hannibal&amp;rsquo;s defeat to get out of Spain honorably. Instead, in 197 BC it created two new Roman provinces, Hispania Citerior whose capital was Carthago Nova and Hispania Ulterior with Corduba as its capital. Soon after, Rome launched a long war to subjugate the Lusitani, Celtiberians on the west coast. During Sulla&amp;rsquo;s dictatorship, the Lusitani were again in revolt, this time under the able leadership of the Roman general Quintus Sertorius, who sought to create an independent, Roman-like state in Hispania. He established a senate and schools for the sons of the local nobility.
Augustus&amp;rsquo;s conquest of Hispania produced a new territorial division that replaced the earlier two-province organization of the region. Augustus divided the whole of the peninsula into three provinces: Hispania Citerior or Tarraconensis, with its capital Tarraco (Tarragona); Hispania Ulterior Baetica, with its capital Corduba (Córdoba); and Hispania Ulterior Lusitania, or Emerita Augusta, with its capital Mérida. The provinces, in turn, were subdivided in administrative legal units, or conventus. The western lands stayed part of the newly demarcated Lusitania, areas into which Romanization had hardly penetrated, in contrast to the other areas of the peninsula where the classical tradition had been incorporated quite early. This division lasted until late antiquity, when Tarraconensis was subdivided into three provinces: Tarraconensis, whose capital continued to be Tarraco (Tarragona), Carthaginiensis, with Carthago Nova (Catagena) as its capital, and Gallaecia, whose capital was Bracara Augusta (Braga, in northern Portugal).
The Mediterranean trio of wine, oil and cereals are the crops most frequently mentioned by all the classical authors when referring to the Iberian Peninsula. These were not the only plants cultivated here. Trogus Pompey, in his Universal History (44. 1-2), praises, as well as those products, the fertility of the soil itself, the benevolence of its climate, the opportune and abundant rains which enable all types of fruits to be gathered, thus supplying every need. He describes the linen and esparto grass as of the highest quality. Strabo recorded the tradition of irrigation as a common practice in pre-Roman agriculture (Strabo 3.2.5). This was continued by the Romans, as shown by the number of aqueducts, dams and small reservoirs still to be found on Spanish soil. Pliny, during his stay as procurator in Spain in the first century, gives more specific descriptions of the flora throughout his Natural History (Book XVI). Martial (Epigrams II) refers to myrtle, box and laurel, as common elements to be found in the garden of country houses in Spain.
It is not strange, therefore, that gardening, the work of the topiarius, was usual in Iberian houses, as this study shows. It was not, however, totally new to Spanish territory. Although there are no literary references to gardening in the Pre-Roman era, it must have been part of Iberian culture, as is proved in an unusual way in the northwest of the peninsula in the area under the influence of Greek culture from the city of Emporion (Ampurias or Empuriae). A Hellenic establishment there, Rhode (Rosas), in the third century BC minted drachmas with a rose as the emblem. There were sacred woods connected with the cities. Close to Augustas Emeritas was Lucus Feroniae. Dedicated to Augustus was Lucus Augusti, which gave rise to the present-day Lugo, in Galicia, and another Lucus existed in the environs of Gijón, the Lugo de Llanera (Blázquez, p. 24).
There has been little research on the gardens in the Roman settlements in Spain and Portugal. In drawing up the list of sites with gardens for this catalog, we have accepted that a garden existed when it was so labeled by the excavators. There are, however, many other probable gardens which we have included. Gorges found just under forty villas where enough remained to draw a plan. In them, certain features help to identify a garden. A peristyle alerts us to suspect a garden, but peristyle courtyards were sometimes paved with stones or bricks over a layer of lime. They were clearly not gardens. But if the courtyard had soil in it, it was in all probability a garden. Fountains, fountain statues, and pools are typical of a garden since water is indispensable for a garden. Most peristyles in Roman villas in Spain had ornamental irrigation channels, semicircular pools, wells or pools that gave the impression of still water that, nevertheless, endowed the garden with a cool humidity that favored the cultivation of plants. In Spain, peristyles with drainage are found in the first and second centuries AD and are also common in the late Empire. Certain types of statuary intimately connected with vegetation and nature are found in gardens, such as divinities related to Bacchus and his circle. At Pompeii, Diana, a garden goddess, sometimes paired with Apollo, is also found. Herms were placed on pilasters, as the examples in situ from Pompeii show. Characteristic of Roman villas was the way in which they opened out to the countryside onto a grand vista of gardens and parks filled with fountains.

  Location Segóbriga
Segóbriga (Pleiades)
Location Description Segóbriga, a deserted Roman city with theater, amphitheater, forum, walls, aqueduct and baths, lies about 100 kilometers southeast of Madrid. Livy speaks of it as a noble and powerful town subdued by the Romans in 179 BC. In the 1st century BC it grew as a center for trade, cereal and cattle production, and for mining gypsum, lapis specularis, then used for windows. It became a municipium in th time of Augustus. The city reached its height near the end of the 1st century AD, then began a slow decline, but even in Visigothic time it sent bishops to councils.
Within the city, there are remarkably few remains of residences. Presumably the population that filled the theater and amphitheater lived in country villas or closer to the mines. The site has been developed as an archaeological park; the monuments are in remarkably good condition and are eminently visitable.

At the end away from the entrance and towards the baths proper was found the base of a statue.

Garden Schola of the Collegium Fabrum
Keywords  garden ornaments nymphaea (garden structures) statues  Garden Description The Schola of the collegium fabrum had a nympheum (a) decorated by a sculptural group of two figures pouring water (a reclining nymph and a group with a drunken Dionysus supported by Silenius) and at least two other sculptures, a sleeping Eros and a herakliskos – the infant Hercules struggling with snakes. The presence of a highly decorative nymphaeum and Dionysiac sculpture group suggests the presence of a garden.

Garden Schola of the Collegium Fabrum
Keywords  garden ornaments nymphaea (garden structures) statues  Garden Description The Schola of the collegium fabrum had a nympheum (a) decorated by a sculptural group of two figures pouring water (a reclining nymph and a group with a drunken Dionysus supported by Silenius) and at least two other sculptures, a sleeping Eros and a herakliskos – the infant Hercules struggling with snakes. The presence of a highly decorative nymphaeum and Dionysiac sculpture group suggests the presence of a garden.

      <description>Province Hispania Tarraconensis
Tarraconensis(Pleiades)
Province Description In 236 BC, to offset Carthage&amp;rsquo;s loss of Sicily and Sardinia in the First Punic War, Hamilcar Barca led an expedition into Hispania to establish a colony there. Through force of arms and diplomacy, he spread Carthaginian influence as far north as Barcellona, which bears his name. In 230 BC, Hasdrubal, his son-in-law, established Qart Hadast that became Carthago Nova in Roman times and Cartagena today. After the death of Hasdrubal, Hannibal, Hamilcar&amp;rsquo;s oldest son, took command, attacked Saguntum, and in 218 set out for Italy leaving his younger brother, Hasdrubal, in command in Spain. Through the Alps, he descended into Italy and threatened Rome for fourteen years. Roman armies under the brothers Gnaeus and Publius Cornelius Scipio kept Hasdrubal in check and prevented his reinforcing Hannibal. They were both killed by the Carthaginians in 212. Two years later, another Publius Cornelius Scipio, the 25-year-old son of the late general of the same name, was sent to Spain. The next year, he captured New Carthage and, in 206 at the battle of Ilipa (about 15 km north of Savilla) destroyed most of the Carthaginians&amp;rsquo; numerically superior army and ended their hold on Spain. Scipio settled his wounded veterans nearby at a place he called Italica to remind them of their origins. Today, it is one of the best Roman archaeological sites in Italy. After a quick trip back to Rome, where he was elected consul, he returned to Spain and went on to attack Carthage itself. Hannibal was recalled to Africa, but Scipio annihilated his army in 202. Rome thus came into possession of the Mediterranean coast of Iberia.
If Rome was drawn into Hispania to keep the Carthaginians there from supporting Hannibal in Italy, it missed the opportunity offered by Hannibal&amp;rsquo;s defeat to get out of Spain honorably. Instead, in 197 BC it created two new Roman provinces, Hispania Citerior whose capital was Carthago Nova and Hispania Ulterior with Corduba as its capital. Soon after, Rome launched a long war to subjugate the Lusitani, Celtiberians on the west coast. During Sulla&amp;rsquo;s dictatorship, the Lusitani were again in revolt, this time under the able leadership of the Roman general Quintus Sertorius, who sought to create an independent, Roman-like state in Hispania. He established a senate and schools for the sons of the local nobility.
Augustus&amp;rsquo;s conquest of Hispania produced a new territorial division that replaced the earlier two-province organization of the region. Augustus divided the whole of the peninsula into three provinces: Hispania Citerior or Tarraconensis, with its capital Tarraco (Tarragona); Hispania Ulterior Baetica, with its capital Corduba (Córdoba); and Hispania Ulterior Lusitania, or Emerita Augusta, with its capital Mérida. The provinces, in turn, were subdivided in administrative legal units, or conventus. The western lands stayed part of the newly demarcated Lusitania, areas into which Romanization had hardly penetrated, in contrast to the other areas of the peninsula where the classical tradition had been incorporated quite early. This division lasted until late antiquity, when Tarraconensis was subdivided into three provinces: Tarraconensis, whose capital continued to be Tarraco (Tarragona), Carthaginiensis, with Carthago Nova (Catagena) as its capital, and Gallaecia, whose capital was Bracara Augusta (Braga, in northern Portugal).
The Mediterranean trio of wine, oil and cereals are the crops most frequently mentioned by all the classical authors when referring to the Iberian Peninsula. These were not the only plants cultivated here. Trogus Pompey, in his Universal History (44. 1-2), praises, as well as those products, the fertility of the soil itself, the benevolence of its climate, the opportune and abundant rains which enable all types of fruits to be gathered, thus supplying every need. He describes the linen and esparto grass as of the highest quality. Strabo recorded the tradition of irrigation as a common practice in pre-Roman agriculture (Strabo 3.2.5). This was continued by the Romans, as shown by the number of aqueducts, dams and small reservoirs still to be found on Spanish soil. Pliny, during his stay as procurator in Spain in the first century, gives more specific descriptions of the flora throughout his Natural History (Book XVI). Martial (Epigrams II) refers to myrtle, box and laurel, as common elements to be found in the garden of country houses in Spain.
It is not strange, therefore, that gardening, the work of the topiarius, was usual in Iberian houses, as this study shows. It was not, however, totally new to Spanish territory. Although there are no literary references to gardening in the Pre-Roman era, it must have been part of Iberian culture, as is proved in an unusual way in the northwest of the peninsula in the area under the influence of Greek culture from the city of Emporion (Ampurias or Empuriae). A Hellenic establishment there, Rhode (Rosas), in the third century BC minted drachmas with a rose as the emblem. There were sacred woods connected with the cities. Close to Augustas Emeritas was Lucus Feroniae. Dedicated to Augustus was Lucus Augusti, which gave rise to the present-day Lugo, in Galicia, and another Lucus existed in the environs of Gijón, the Lugo de Llanera (Blázquez, p. 24).
There has been little research on the gardens in the Roman settlements in Spain and Portugal. In drawing up the list of sites with gardens for this catalog, we have accepted that a garden existed when it was so labeled by the excavators. There are, however, many other probable gardens which we have included. Gorges found just under forty villas where enough remained to draw a plan. In them, certain features help to identify a garden. A peristyle alerts us to suspect a garden, but peristyle courtyards were sometimes paved with stones or bricks over a layer of lime. They were clearly not gardens. But if the courtyard had soil in it, it was in all probability a garden. Fountains, fountain statues, and pools are typical of a garden since water is indispensable for a garden. Most peristyles in Roman villas in Spain had ornamental irrigation channels, semicircular pools, wells or pools that gave the impression of still water that, nevertheless, endowed the garden with a cool humidity that favored the cultivation of plants. In Spain, peristyles with drainage are found in the first and second centuries AD and are also common in the late Empire. Certain types of statuary intimately connected with vegetation and nature are found in gardens, such as divinities related to Bacchus and his circle. At Pompeii, Diana, a garden goddess, sometimes paired with Apollo, is also found. Herms were placed on pilasters, as the examples in situ from Pompeii show. Characteristic of Roman villas was the way in which they opened out to the countryside onto a grand vista of gardens and parks filled with fountains.
The roughly triangular province of Tarraconensis, by far the largest of the three provinces of the Iberian Peninsula, stretched across the north side of modern Spain and down the east coast as far as Almeria. On the Atlantic coast, it reached as far south as present Oporto.

Garden Theater
Keywords  nymphaea (garden structures) cryptoportici fountains stairs  Garden Description The theater of Tarraco is poorly preserved. Part of the orchestra, the proscaenium, the scaena frons, the first five rows of seats, and a cryptoporticus running parallel to the curved façade survive. Connected to the theater was a monumental nympheum (a) and a large garden area (b), through which privileged spectators passed to be seated in the first rows. The garden, constructed in the first century A.D. along with the theater, included the nympheum, which was in the center of a large blind wall with pilasters bordering the uneven hill. Two large bases flanked the nympheum and perhaps held monumental craters. Water from the fountain passed into a large pool, four meters deep, with fountains at either end. This large pool had walls lined with opus signinum and was topped with a molded raised edge. It now lies buried beneath a neighboring plot of ground. A small door at the end of the pilaster wall joined this whole unit to the theater. From the door, one reached the parascenium, and by means of stairs to the west, one reached the entrance of the theater.

The ruins are reburied beneath the earth in a field, awaiting funds to present them properly. The villa was built in the first third of the 2nd century, destroyed by the Germanic invasions of the years immediately after 256, then rebuilt and enlarged under the restored empire, and finally abandoned in the 5th century. The large central peristyle courtyard (43.5 x 19 m) had porticoes on all four sides and a garden with a drainage system in the middle. On the south side, the room with the circular, quadrilobed interior had a mosaic of Ceres and a cornucopia. A series of agricultural buildings and other gardens joined it on the north side.

      <description>Province Hispania Tarraconensis
Tarraconensis(Pleiades)
Province Description In 236 BC, to offset Carthage&amp;rsquo;s loss of Sicily and Sardinia in the First Punic War, Hamilcar Barca led an expedition into Hispania to establish a colony there. Through force of arms and diplomacy, he spread Carthaginian influence as far north as Barcellona, which bears his name. In 230 BC, Hasdrubal, his son-in-law, established Qart Hadast that became Carthago Nova in Roman times and Cartagena today. After the death of Hasdrubal, Hannibal, Hamilcar&amp;rsquo;s oldest son, took command, attacked Saguntum, and in 218 set out for Italy leaving his younger brother, Hasdrubal, in command in Spain. Through the Alps, he descended into Italy and threatened Rome for fourteen years. Roman armies under the brothers Gnaeus and Publius Cornelius Scipio kept Hasdrubal in check and prevented his reinforcing Hannibal. They were both killed by the Carthaginians in 212. Two years later, another Publius Cornelius Scipio, the 25-year-old son of the late general of the same name, was sent to Spain. The next year, he captured New Carthage and, in 206 at the battle of Ilipa (about 15 km north of Savilla) destroyed most of the Carthaginians&amp;rsquo; numerically superior army and ended their hold on Spain. Scipio settled his wounded veterans nearby at a place he called Italica to remind them of their origins. Today, it is one of the best Roman archaeological sites in Italy. After a quick trip back to Rome, where he was elected consul, he returned to Spain and went on to attack Carthage itself. Hannibal was recalled to Africa, but Scipio annihilated his army in 202. Rome thus came into possession of the Mediterranean coast of Iberia.
If Rome was drawn into Hispania to keep the Carthaginians there from supporting Hannibal in Italy, it missed the opportunity offered by Hannibal&amp;rsquo;s defeat to get out of Spain honorably. Instead, in 197 BC it created two new Roman provinces, Hispania Citerior whose capital was Carthago Nova and Hispania Ulterior with Corduba as its capital. Soon after, Rome launched a long war to subjugate the Lusitani, Celtiberians on the west coast. During Sulla&amp;rsquo;s dictatorship, the Lusitani were again in revolt, this time under the able leadership of the Roman general Quintus Sertorius, who sought to create an independent, Roman-like state in Hispania. He established a senate and schools for the sons of the local nobility.
Augustus&amp;rsquo;s conquest of Hispania produced a new territorial division that replaced the earlier two-province organization of the region. Augustus divided the whole of the peninsula into three provinces: Hispania Citerior or Tarraconensis, with its capital Tarraco (Tarragona); Hispania Ulterior Baetica, with its capital Corduba (Córdoba); and Hispania Ulterior Lusitania, or Emerita Augusta, with its capital Mérida. The provinces, in turn, were subdivided in administrative legal units, or conventus. The western lands stayed part of the newly demarcated Lusitania, areas into which Romanization had hardly penetrated, in contrast to the other areas of the peninsula where the classical tradition had been incorporated quite early. This division lasted until late antiquity, when Tarraconensis was subdivided into three provinces: Tarraconensis, whose capital continued to be Tarraco (Tarragona), Carthaginiensis, with Carthago Nova (Catagena) as its capital, and Gallaecia, whose capital was Bracara Augusta (Braga, in northern Portugal).
The Mediterranean trio of wine, oil and cereals are the crops most frequently mentioned by all the classical authors when referring to the Iberian Peninsula. These were not the only plants cultivated here. Trogus Pompey, in his Universal History (44. 1-2), praises, as well as those products, the fertility of the soil itself, the benevolence of its climate, the opportune and abundant rains which enable all types of fruits to be gathered, thus supplying every need. He describes the linen and esparto grass as of the highest quality. Strabo recorded the tradition of irrigation as a common practice in pre-Roman agriculture (Strabo 3.2.5). This was continued by the Romans, as shown by the number of aqueducts, dams and small reservoirs still to be found on Spanish soil. Pliny, during his stay as procurator in Spain in the first century, gives more specific descriptions of the flora throughout his Natural History (Book XVI). Martial (Epigrams II) refers to myrtle, box and laurel, as common elements to be found in the garden of country houses in Spain.
It is not strange, therefore, that gardening, the work of the topiarius, was usual in Iberian houses, as this study shows. It was not, however, totally new to Spanish territory. Although there are no literary references to gardening in the Pre-Roman era, it must have been part of Iberian culture, as is proved in an unusual way in the northwest of the peninsula in the area under the influence of Greek culture from the city of Emporion (Ampurias or Empuriae). A Hellenic establishment there, Rhode (Rosas), in the third century BC minted drachmas with a rose as the emblem. There were sacred woods connected with the cities. Close to Augustas Emeritas was Lucus Feroniae. Dedicated to Augustus was Lucus Augusti, which gave rise to the present-day Lugo, in Galicia, and another Lucus existed in the environs of Gijón, the Lugo de Llanera (Blázquez, p. 24).
There has been little research on the gardens in the Roman settlements in Spain and Portugal. In drawing up the list of sites with gardens for this catalog, we have accepted that a garden existed when it was so labeled by the excavators. There are, however, many other probable gardens which we have included. Gorges found just under forty villas where enough remained to draw a plan. In them, certain features help to identify a garden. A peristyle alerts us to suspect a garden, but peristyle courtyards were sometimes paved with stones or bricks over a layer of lime. They were clearly not gardens. But if the courtyard had soil in it, it was in all probability a garden. Fountains, fountain statues, and pools are typical of a garden since water is indispensable for a garden. Most peristyles in Roman villas in Spain had ornamental irrigation channels, semicircular pools, wells or pools that gave the impression of still water that, nevertheless, endowed the garden with a cool humidity that favored the cultivation of plants. In Spain, peristyles with drainage are found in the first and second centuries AD and are also common in the late Empire. Certain types of statuary intimately connected with vegetation and nature are found in gardens, such as divinities related to Bacchus and his circle. At Pompeii, Diana, a garden goddess, sometimes paired with Apollo, is also found. Herms were placed on pilasters, as the examples in situ from Pompeii show. Characteristic of Roman villas was the way in which they opened out to the countryside onto a grand vista of gardens and parks filled with fountains.
The roughly triangular province of Tarraconensis, by far the largest of the three provinces of the Iberian Peninsula, stretched across the north side of modern Spain and down the east coast as far as Almeria. On the Atlantic coast, it reached as far south as present Oporto.

The Laguna Cernea is an artificial pond created by the Romans for washing gold, now frequently dry. It was presumably the residence of the offical in charge of the gold extraction. Its early, first century date underlines the importance of gold as a reason for determination of Augustus to subdue the region at great cost.
Built under Tiberius, this site is a rare if not unique example of a first century Iberian villa for which we have a complete plan. Excavation began in the 1930&amp;rsquo;s. Of modest dimensions and without mosaics, it followed an Italian plan with a central (slightly trapezoidal) peristyle with little adaptation to the much cooler climate at this elevation. It did, however, have several rooms heated by hypocausts and many rooms paved in opus signinum. There were found many fragments of wall painting (of deer, birds, and humans) and of ceramic and glass. In the center of the peristyle was a rectangular pool with protruding semi-circular niches at each corner; it was lined with painted stucco. The garden around the pool was open on the north side in front of the reception room [1]. In a later modification, the west portico was divided into four small rooms beside the garden.

In the center of its grand peristyle courtyard (41 x 22 m.) was a structure which may have been part of a water supply system for the garden in the courtyard. The main reception room (Fig. 1, 1, in the center of the north wing) had a wide opening onto the garden and a passage through the low wall which otherwise surrounded the garden on three sides and half of the fourth. Likewise room [2] on the east side, possibly a triclinium, had a good view of the garden. An unusual feature, however, is that, with the exception of these two rooms, all the other rooms around the porticoes of the peristyle did not open directly onto the portico but onto narrow corridors perpendicular to the portico. Thus, unless they had windows, they did not get light and air directly from the garden courtyard.

Location PEDROSA DE LA VEGA
La Olmeda (Pleiades)
Location Description The size, quality, and excellent state of preservation of the mosaics of this villa make it an arehaeological jewel. In an area known since the Middle Ages as La Olmeda (the Elm Grove), it was discovered in 1968 by Javier Cortes, the owner of the land, as he was about to level the area for an irrigation project. He immediately recognized its value and involved Pedro de Paloa, a professional archaeologist. Its scientific exploration was financed by Cortes until the site was given to the provincial government in 1980. Excavation continued to 1986. Great care has been taken to preserve the mosaics and lower parts of the villa walls in their original place. In 2005, construction began on a new, 6.2 million euro protective shell and facility to accommodate some 40,000 visitors a year. The Museo Monográfico de la Villa de Pedrosa de la Vega has been created in the old chuch of San Pedro in Saldaña to display the many tools, coins, ceramics, glass and other daily objects from the villa and the extensive nearby cemeteries.
The villa is best reached by a well-marked road turning to the west from CL-615 in Gañinas de la Vega, 3.6 km south of the intersection of CL-615 with CL-624 just south of Saldaña. (CL-615 is the road from Palencia to Saldaña.)
Garden La Olmeda
Keywords  peristyles (Roman courtyards) mosaics (visual works) corridors  Garden Description The major building period dated to the beginning of the 4th century, supplanting an earlier late 1st century phase.. The peristyle garden belonged to the later phase. The house is laid out around its central garden with approximate symmetry relative its north-south axis. The front of the house, the side from which guests entered, was clearly the south where the entry way [25] had a geometric mosaic floor whereas the north entrance way [7] had an earthen floor. Immediately on entry, the guest would have seen the garden through an arcade on its south side. These nine semicircular arches formed a sort of interior façade. This arcade had fallen over – or been pushed pulled over – in the destruction of the house, so it has been possible to reconstruct it in elevation, and it has been rebuilt. The Romans made extensive use of the round arch for practical purposes; this is an interesting example of its use for purely esthetic purposes, since a simple colonnade would have served just as well structurally.
In the center of the nearly square garden was a small fountain which has disappeared. It was surrounded by a small mosaic which survived only as scattered tessera. Crossing the garden in an east-west direction was a pergola. A low wall under the arches prevented guests from entering directly into the garden. Rather, a walk with impressive geometric mosaics led to the main reception room [1] with a vast polychrome mosaic depicting Achilles discovered by Odyssesus among the women of the household of Lycomedes. This mosaic is believed to be one of the largest known figured polychrome mosaic of the Roman world. From the reception room one entered the garden, through the pérgola to the bath complex. The walks around the garden in the porticoes were completely covered with geometric mosaics. A variety of rooms opened off the garden peristyle, offering a variety of spaces for entertaining and activities of daily life. Many did not open directly on the garden but may have had window through which to view the garden. Javier Cortes noted that hardware was found around the edges of the garden suitable for wood vanes which may have closed the spaces between the columns in cold weather. Asked about the quality of the soil in the garden, he replied that it was rich but so was all the soil in this river bottom area.
The large number of objects of daily life found in the ruins, some under toppled walls, makes it clear that the villa was violently destroyed, probably in the second half of the fifth century, though the date is uncertain.

Keywords  mosaics (visual works) corridors  Garden Description The first finds go back to 1883. Part of the site was acquired by the provincial government in 1954 and archaeological work was begun the next year, but the reports remain unpublished.
The villa from the middle of the 2nd century evolved around a peristyle garden with a large circular pool, 7.6 meters in inside diameter, in the middle. A paved corridor led to the pool from the north gallery of the peristyle. There were baths and two rooms with mosaic floors. Most rooms, however, had floors of hammered earth.

Rioseco Di Soria (Pleiades)
Location Description This villa is about 600 meters southwest of the town Rioseco di Soria on the right (north) bank of the Sequillo river – here a small stream &amp;ndash; and overlooking its plain. Excavations go back to the early 1970&amp;rsquo;s. In 2007 the site was marked only by mounds of earth over the ruins.
Garden Villa los Quintanares
Keywords  peristyles (Roman courtyards) mosaics (visual works)  Garden Description Built in the second half of the 2nd century CE, it was destroyed during the invasions of the Franks after 256. Following the recovery of the Empire under Claudius II and Aurelian (268 -275), it was rebuilt and enlarged, surviving into the 5th century. Water was brought to the villa by a conduit from 1.5 km further up the Sequillo. The villa is built around two peristyles of similar size. The surrounding rooms featured more than 30 mosaics. The western peristyle (11 x 11 m) was built first, with porticoes on all four sides of its central garden, and, a double gallery on the north side against the summer sun. The later, eastern half had a slightly larger peristyle (12.5 x 21 m), with galleries on three sides of its garden. A large hall extended directly off the fourth side. The peristyle was richly adorned with sculptures, mosaics, and mural paintings.
