Location Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s Villa (Pleiades)
Location Description DESCRIPTION
Villa Adriana, erected by emperor Hadrian at the beginning of the II cent. A.D., occupies a vast area of 126 hectares. It was a beautiful estate strategically located near Tivoli and, at the same time, not very far from Rome (WINNEFELD 1895; KÄHLER 1950; AURIGEMMA 1961; RAKOB 1973; BROWN 1964). Prior to the Hadrianic settlement, an ancient villa, dating back to the late republican time, already stood there. Probably it belonged to Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s family and, as a matter of fact, many scholars think that Hadrian chose this estate as the ideal one because he already knew the place and was attached to it (LUGLI 1927). Certainly he preserved and restored the original building and made it the nucleus of his private quarters.
The realization of this magnificent residence must have been a cherished dream of Hadrian, and he must have planned it long before becoming an emperor. This is the only way to explain how the works for its construction began immediately after his election and his return to Rome in 118 A.D. Hadrian died in 138 A.D. when his ideal residence was nearly completed. Nearly, because there was still some work to be done. Some important halls of the Great Baths were not finished, and the model for a Stadium, found among the ruins of his last building-yard in the quarters of the stonecutters (CAPRINO 1996-97; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992-93, p. 73; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 144-147), was never brought to the unknown place where Hadrian had planned to build it. The Emperor&amp;rsquo;s death put an abrupt end to all activities, and some of the gardens he planned to create, and for which fountains and pavilions had already been built, were never done or, if ever they were completed, seem to have been soon abandoned (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992-93, pp. 000-000). As a matter of fact after him Villa Adriana was only partially lived in by his successors and was solely used for occasional visits. It became just one of the many country houses pertaining to the imperial praedia. Some of the existing gardens (Fig. 1), the ones nearer to the center of the residence and the monumental ones, were maintained and irrigated up to the end of the Roman Empire, a fact which is now proved by the concentration of extractable lead found in their soil, and which is due to the use of lead pipes for irrigation (FOSS ET ALII 1990; FOSS 1989-90; FOSS 1992; TIMPSON ET ALII 1994; FOSS, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1996). As a consequence of Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s death, some others sites, which he had planned to be attractive and important, got no irrigation at all, thus their soil contains only a minimal quantity of extractable lead, about the same amount that is ordinarily found in modern agricultural fields.
Garden Antinous&amp;rsquo; tomb (Fig. 1, n. 25) Antinoeion at Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s Villa (Pleiades)
Keywords  nymphaea (garden structures) tombs  Garden Description When, after having asked Dr. Reggiani to write about the garden emerged by her excavations, I began to study the map she kindly sent me (Fig. 75). Mari had informed me that the big structure beside the entrance gate was a Nymphaeum, but this seemed to me really improbable: It was too big and not in scale with the rest. I soon discovered that not only it was not a Nymphaeum but that it was a tomb and I easily connected it with Antinous, the same Antinous who had been deified by the Egyptians (E. SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2002-2003). Hadrian was more than pleased to accept him as a god, thus he could build to his memory a very important monument, something that he could never do for a simple boy. A temple more than a tomb.
I told my discovery to Dr. Reggiani and she decided to send Mari - who up to then had been absolutely sure of his Nymphaeum theory - to do a probe and test my hypothesis.
The excavations proved that I was right and that, also if never completed, there the tomb was made. First of all after his return from his second voyage around his empire Hadrian searched for the right place where to build it and drew his plan (Fig. 76). The place he chose was in direct view from his own quarters so that he would be able to see it - as we say -, “ first time in the morning, last time at night” (Fig. 77). As the area was slanting, the first thing he did was to prepare a platform for the temple and the surrounding garden (Fig. 78).
From our researches we understood that at Hadrian’s death in the 138 A.D. the garden with its Egyptian temples and its enclosure was the only thing to have been completed. The part where the temple-tomb would have been erected (Fig. 79) was only indicated by the big stones with which the architects traced on the ground the principal lines of their plans (VITRUVIUS, I CENT B.C.; W. JONES). However the garden was there and from the soil analysis we also learned that it did survive until the end of the Empire and that was proved by the content of lead of its soil, the same quantity of the one we find in the Canopus’ area and in the other monumental parts of the Imperial Residence created on the plots of never irrigated land acquired by Hadrian, and tended up from the first II century’s years till the end of the Roman Empire (J. E. FOSS, 1989-1990; J. E. FOSS e E. SALZA PRINA RICOTTI, 1996).
Of course all Hadrian’s successors had no intention to complete Hadrian’s plan and, just to give the garden a finishing touch, they substituted the colossal temple-tomb by a modest porch where Hadrian would not even bury a dog (Figg. 80 and 81).
However the garden had been completed and we could reconstruct it basing ourselves on the trenches for the boxtrees edges and the flowering bushes that had been cut in the tufa (Fig. 82). Then, going on, studying its interesting facade wall with niches for statues on both sides, the east ones turned to the entrance road and the west ones looking at the garden (Fig. 83): 20 niches in which probably the 20 Egyptian statue found in the CVII and CVIII centuries excavations were displayed (C. FEA, 1790). Probably here at the two sides of the entrance door stood the two Telamons (H. WINNEFELD, 1895; E. Q. VISCONTI, 1782; II, 18; PENNA III, 29) similar to the representation of Antinous as an Egyptian god (WINNEFELD, 1895) (Fig. 84) the one that with a Harpocrates, had been found in a nearby store room. No document exists for the two Telamons now set at the two sides of the entrance of the “Sala rotonda” in the Vatican Museums, but it is pretty certain that these two statues which in 1500 were set at the two sides of the door of Tivoli’s archbishopric see have been excavated in the Antinous’ tomb area.
In the garden people could admire low white marble basins in which pure water fell by the over standing niches, the two Egyptian marble temple ad all sort of adornments. At the end it was also completed by an obelisk on which, in hieroglyphs, was inscribed the following declaration:
 The god we find (Antinous represented in the destroyed higher part of the obelisk) rests in this place that is hidden in the property of “the Lord of prosperity” (princeps) of Rome (then Hadrian in his Villa Adriana).
 Basing myself on all this information I drew a garden looking probably like the old one (Fig. 85).
Obviously then, with the fall of the Roman empire and the Barbarian invasions, this place stood exposed to all the pillages that ruined the Roman’s monuments. Heliogabalus began taking the obelisk and bringing it to Rome to be placed in his new circus. Then there were the pillages of the Middle Age. For centuries the local people considered Villa Adriana as an enormous quarry where they went to refurnish their churches of columns and their floors with luxurious slabs of marbles (Fig. 86). They also took bricks for their buildings and burned in their kilns fragments of statues or architectonic moldings to make lime (Fig. 87). They thought it was a very nice thing to do, because, starting from the VIII cent. A.D., the Church requested all believers to destroy the “pagan” works of art and they did it with enthusiasm: Besides completing this “worthy action”, it helped them to obtain the best lime possible for their mortar.
After the passage or this horde of locusts the only things that were left to Villa Adriana were its naked walls and not even all of them, because in 1650, when the Jesuits decided to make there a thriving vineyard, they completely cleaned the area and demolished all the walls that were still standing in Antinous’ garden. The only things that were left untouched were the bases of the two temples. To destroy those large masses of conglomerate would have taken lot of work. Thus they were left there where they stood, and, cutting low trenches in them, were treated exactly as if the they were part of the tufa’s platform (Figg. 88 and 89).
Today on this rocky plain, left naked by an exaggerate excavation, we can see all that happened here, from the big mass of marble fragments prepared for the kilns (and that was left there by the local people who, now had more than enough lime, and never burned them) to the long furrow traced in the tufa platform by the holy Fathers in such a way as to held rain water in them, keep always humid the soil and by capillarity irrigate the young vines.
As we have said at the beginning the Temple-tomb was never completed. Antinous who, at the end of the works, would have been transported there, was left in Antinoopolis’ temple (J. C. GRENIER 1986). Anyway he now was a god with a well asserted religion, and temples (Fig. 90) in a great part of the known world. A cult that thrived up to the middle of the IV century (ATTANASIUS 350 A.D.). However also if Antinous was left in the desert’s sands his memory is still here and visiting Villa Adriana, one can always feel his presence.

Keywords  terrace gardens  Garden Description The principal element of this garden (Fig. 28) is the sustaining wall of the overhanging terrace, a kind of theater scenery decorated by a series of 23 alternatively semicircular and square niches (Fig. 29).
However the garden did not occupy the entire plateau. A substantial concentration of lead is found only in the area set in front of the sustaining wall where a garden with its flowerbeds must have been set, while the most northern part of the plateau, where lead is scantily present, must have been occupied by trees and bushes which did not need much watering (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1994-95, fig. 7).

Some important halls of the Great Baths were not finished, and the model for a Stadium, found among the ruins of his last building-yard in the quarters of the stonecutters (CAPRINO 1996-97; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992-93, p. 73; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 144-147), was never brought to the unknown place where Hadrian had planned to build it. The Emperor&amp;rsquo;s death put an abrupt end to all activities, and some of the gardens he planned to create, and for which fountains and pavilions had already been built, were never done or, if ever they were completed, seem to have been soon abandoned (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992-93, pp. 000-000). As a matter of fact after him Villa Adriana was only partially lived in by his successors and was solely used for occasional visits. It became just one of the many country houses pertaining to the imperial praedia. Some of the existing gardens (Fig. 1), the ones nearer to the center of the residence and the monumental ones, were maintained and irrigated up to the end of the Roman Empire, a fact which is now proved by the concentration of extractable lead found in their soil, and which is due to the use of lead pipes for irrigation (FOSS ET ALII 1990; FOSS 1989-90; FOSS 1992; TIMPSON ET ALII 1994; FOSS, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1996). As a consequence of Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s death, some others sites, which he had planned to be attractive and important, got no irrigation at all, thus their soil contains only a minimal quantity of extractable lead, about the same amount that is ordinarily found in modern agricultural fields.
Garden Garden between the nymphaeum on the E side of the Academy and the Praetorium (Fig. 1, n. 24)
Keywords  exedrae (site elements) fountains nymphaea (garden structures)  Garden Description These gardens, (Fig. 72) never completed, would probably have covered 35.000 square meters. One extended itself between the impressive Nymphaeum waterfall (Fig. 73) set at the eastern side of the Academy and the noble upper part of the so-called Praetorium where a beautiful exedra occupied the center of an elegant pavilion (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1998, pp. 388-390, fig. 17; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 377-381, fig. 137). The two elements faced each other at a distance of 347 m. The minimal presence of lead in the soil of this area and its position connected with the palatial Academy - which now, due to the results of the soil analyses, we know was never completed or inhabited – explain what happened. After the nymphaeum with its beautiful waterfalls (Fig.74) and the facing Praetorium pavilion had been erected, Hadrian died. Everything stopped and Villa Adriana was never completed. Thus, today we can only see the two principal features of this garden: the pavilion and the nymphaeum.
The waterfall-nymphaeum is a very interesting garden monument. Pirro Ligorio first documented it in a sketch now found in the Royal Library of Windsor Castle. It was also represented in all the successive maps of Villa Adriana, starting from Contini, and up to my time. Unluckily Ligorio&amp;rsquo;s plan was faulty and, what is even worse, everybody copied his drawing without taking the pain to study it more thoroughly. Ligorio&amp;rsquo;s error was probably due to the masses of brambles that usually cover these ruins. It seems possible that the only elements that he could see were a small portion of the first waterfall and the total extension of the nymphaeum. Thus he reconstructed what was hidden by the vegetation following his own fantasy and sketched it as a series of narrow waterfalls, obtaining an effect very similar to the one given to visitors of the Villa d&amp;rsquo;Este at Tivoli by the celebrated alley of the “Cento Fontanelle”.
I had the chance to find this nymphaeum cleaned from vegetation and therefore I was able to survey it properly (Fig. 73). Originally it seems to have consisted of eight waterfalls, 3.55 m wide, four on each side of a very large one 15 m wide. The waterfalls were divided by pillars of masonry of 2.30 x 1.50 m decorated by semicircular niches 1.40 m wide and m 1.90 high.
In a second moment, after the nymphaeum had been completed, the first small waterfall on the western side was destroyed and an exit to the Great Carriages Underground Road was created in its place. To understand when this change was done we must keep in mind that, as the last findings about lead content of the archaeological sites&amp;rsquo; soil prove, the Academy, that was probably destined to Sabina, who - I suspect - returned ailing from her travels with Hadrian and never came to Villa Adriana. She stayed in Rome and there she died. Thus the access of the carriages to this area must have been decided in Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s time, when it was still thought that the residence would have been lived in. The successors of Hadrian; who didn&amp;rsquo;t wish to occupy this part of Villa Adriana, would never have cared to open an access to the underground carriages road. In conclusion this change must have been done between 128 and 136 A.D. It certainly was decided by Hadrian.

Location Description DESCRIPTION
Villa Adriana, erected by emperor Hadrian at the beginning of the II cent. A.D., occupies a vast area of 126 hectares. It was a beautiful estate strategically located near Tivoli and, at the same time, not very far from Rome (WINNEFELD 1895; KÄHLER 1950; AURIGEMMA 1961; RAKOB 1973; BROWN 1964). Prior to the Hadrianic settlement, an ancient villa, dating back to the late republican time, already stood there. Probably it belonged to Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s family and, as a matter of fact, many scholars think that Hadrian chose this estate as the ideal one because he already knew the place and was attached to it (LUGLI 1927). Certainly he preserved and restored the original building and made it the nucleus of his private quarters.
The realization of this magnificent residence must have been a cherished dream of Hadrian, and he must have planned it long before becoming an emperor. This is the only way to explain how the works for its construction began immediately after his election and his return to Rome in 118 A.D. Hadrian died in 138 A.D. when his ideal residence was nearly completed. Nearly, because there was still some work to be done. Some important halls of the Great Baths were not finished, and the model for a Stadium, found among the ruins of his last building-yard in the quarters of the stonecutters (CAPRINO 1996-97; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992-93, p. 73; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 144-147), was never brought to the unknown place where Hadrian had planned to build it. The Emperor&amp;rsquo;s death put an abrupt end to all activities, and some of the gardens he planned to create, and for which fountains and pavilions had already been built, were never done or, if ever they were completed, seem to have been soon abandoned (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992-93, pp. 000-000). As a matter of fact after him Villa Adriana was only partially lived in by his successors and was solely used for occasional visits. It became just one of the many country houses pertaining to the imperial praedia. Some of the existing gardens (Fig. 1), the ones nearer to the center of the residence and the monumental ones, were maintained and irrigated up to the end of the Roman Empire, a fact which is now proved by the concentration of extractable lead found in their soil, and which is due to the use of lead pipes for irrigation (FOSS ET ALII 1990; FOSS 1989-90; FOSS 1992; TIMPSON ET ALII 1994; FOSS, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1996). As a consequence of Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s death, some others sites, which he had planned to be attractive and important, got no irrigation at all, thus their soil contains only a minimal quantity of extractable lead, about the same amount that is ordinarily found in modern agricultural fields.
Garden Garden in the courtyard of the buildings to the East of the Inferi Nymphaeum (Fig. 1, n. 22)
Keywords  exedrae (site elements) nymphaea (garden structures)  Garden Description The presence of a garden on the eastern side of this luxurious pavilion with its monumental exedra is denounced by the high presence of lead in its soil (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1994-95, fig. 7). Although peripheral to the Hadrianic residence, this place must have been of great importance. There was a very large building that at this moment is still a bit of mystery (Figg. 65 and 66). It is quite far away, it has a monumental terrace on which Piranesi imagined a little round temple; during my survey I found fragments of fine marbles all around it and the floors of the rooms around the terrace are paved with mosaic. Apart of all this it must have had some special meaning also for the successors of Hadrian as it was tended with particular care up to the end of the Empire. That is very strange. This garden is set in an area where some very important buildings, as the Academy, the Odeon and other luxurious pavilions existed but, at Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s death, were abandoned and never watered, while the so called “Temple of Pluto&amp;rdquo; was tended up till the end of the Roman Empire. We can&amp;rsquo;t avoid asking ourselves: “Why?”
The only explanation seems to be the fact that Hadrian, who not only was introduced to the Eleusinian mysteries but reached in them the highest degree. Thus he could have wanted to recreate in his residence a memento of them, and not only as Spartianus wrote: “ And as nothing could be missed, there he created also the Inferi.” A death reign all for him! I don’t think it is very alluring, but a memento to the Eleusinian misteries, definitely yes, and for this it is acceptable to believe that he created a big holy building and near by a grotto to remember everybody of the Plutonium (Fig. 67).

Garden Description Quite certainly there was a garden here, but we don&amp;rsquo;t have any elements to help us to reconstruct its appearance (Fig. 36). Only a trench was by me excavated in the western part of the courtyard, just in front of the Hadrianic stibadium used in summer for open-air dining (Fig.37). I wanted to ascertain if here, as in the Canopus&amp;rsquo; coenatio, there had also been an euripus, but the probe gave no result, and anyway the digging was too limited to help our understanding of the place.

Hadrian died in 138 A.D. when his ideal residence was nearly completed. Nearly, because there was still some work to be done. Some important halls of the Great Baths were not finished, and the model for a Stadium, found among the ruins of his last building-yard in the quarters of the stonecutters (CAPRINO 1996-97; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992-93, p. 73; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 144-147), was never brought to the unknown place where Hadrian had planned to build it. The Emperor&amp;rsquo;s death put an abrupt end to all activities, and some of the gardens he planned to create, and for which fountains and pavilions had already been built, were never done or, if ever they were completed, seem to have been soon abandoned (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992-93, pp. 000-000). As a matter of fact after him Villa Adriana was only partially lived in by his successors and was solely used for occasional visits. It became just one of the many country houses pertaining to the imperial praedia. Some of the existing gardens (Fig. 1), the ones nearer to the center of the residence and the monumental ones, were maintained and irrigated up to the end of the Roman Empire, a fact which is now proved by the concentration of extractable lead found in their soil, and which is due to the use of lead pipes for irrigation (FOSS ET ALII 1990; FOSS 1989-90; FOSS 1992; TIMPSON ET ALII 1994; FOSS, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1996). As a consequence of Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s death, some others sites, which he had planned to be attractive and important, got no irrigation at all, thus their soil contains only a minimal quantity of extractable lead, about the same amount that is ordinarily found in modern agricultural fields.
Garden Garden of the triclinium North of the Maritime Theatre (Fig. 1, n. 7)
Keywords  cyzigene fountains nymphaea (garden structures) triclinia  Garden Description Today what is left of this garden is a nymphaeum 7 m long and 3.50 m large. It was set against a wall on its northern side and served as a background to the area. It consisted of a small, marble lined fountain, with a basin at its front and five square niches set on a semieliptic line at its back (Fig. 23). On the southern end, a porch, with a white mosaic paving, was set in front of a triclinium of the kind called cyzigene, which means a dining room encircled by a garden (Fig. 24). That left free only an area 34 m long and 21 m wide, set between the triclinium and the nymphaeum; not very much but quite enough to create a pleasant green scenery.
This garden, which stood between two of the highlights of Villa Adriana - the Teatro Marittimo to the South, and the Libraries to the East - while the red marble statue of a faun - one of the most important masterpieces found in this imperial residence - was discovered walled up in a niche of the sustaining wall of its terrace, was certainly very important.

Prior to the Hadrianic settlement, an ancient villa, dating back to the late republican time, already stood there. Probably it belonged to Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s family and, as a matter of fact, many scholars think that Hadrian chose this estate as the ideal one because he already knew the place and was attached to it (LUGLI 1927).

Garden Garden on a terrace (Fig. 1, n. 15)
Keywords  columns (architectural elements) porticoes  Garden Description This garden was placed to the east of the Palace and, looking the Valley of Tempe, was sustained by a huge wall (Fig. 1, 15). Now nothing of it is left, but in ancient times a long portico ran all along the eastern side of the terrace. For what is written in Contini&amp;rsquo;s notes, in 1658 many columns of gray marble with corinthian capitals were still standing in the place. Afterwards, Piranesi (who, in 1781, surveyed Villa Adriana, and published a new map of it) found that some of them had been brought to the Vatican Museums. Today only the beautiful view from the terrace and the considerable presence of lead in the soil (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1994-95, fig. 7) denounces the presence of this ancient garden.

Garden Palace nymphaeum (Fig. 1, n. 16)
Keywords  nymphaea (garden structures)  Garden Description The Palace nymphaeum (LUGLI 1927) has already been published quite extensively in the proceedings of the last symposium on ancient Roman Gardens held in Rome in 1995 (JASHEMSKI, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1987-88, pp. 151-154, figs. 6-8; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1998, pp. 385-388, figs. 15-16; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 361-367, figs. 129-133). This water theater was shaped like an auditorium. A monumental entry (Fig. 38, H) led the way to a large paved area where low walls contained either two oval flowerbeds or two small basins (Fig. 38 A). An emicycle concluded the arrangement and sustained the pressure of the higher grounds that rose at the back of the garden.
To understand how it must have been we can study the two cross sections. One, W –W1, shows us the front of the badly ruined nymphaeum (Fig. 39). It collected the water that fell in it presumably to feed the same kind of small marble lined waterfalls we have seen in the so-called Stadium. Probably the same hedges of box trees grown in big mortar containers were set amid them. The other cross section (S – S1) show what once was the emicyle in very bad condition (Fig. 40). During the centuries following the fall of the Roman Empire it was destroyed by the peasants who occupied the area, and its decoration has been completely pillaged leaving only the concrete of the basements. Luckily finding some elements, like the remains of a cistern which provided the water for the water falls, the canal circling the top of the emicycle, and the bottom one which runs on the side of the mixtilinear basin (the same technical elements which we find in the so-called Stadium emicycle), give us the possibility to reconstruct the nymphaeum (Fig. 41).
We can have an idea how it looked at the beginning of the XIX century in a drawing by Penna (Fig. 42). However the modern situation is even worse (Fig. 43). We made a probe along the emicycle (Fig. 44) and at its top we found the rest of the same kind of canal that in the Stadium Nymphaeum brought water to the small marble lined waterfall (Fig. 45). It was then possible to understand that the two were quite similar.

As a matter of fact after him Villa Adriana was only partially lived in by his successors and was solely used for occasional visits. It became just one of the many country houses pertaining to the imperial praedia. Some of the existing gardens (Fig. 1), the ones nearer to the center of the residence and the monumental ones, were maintained and irrigated up to the end of the Roman Empire, a fact which is now proved by the concentration of extractable lead found in their soil, and which is due to the use of lead pipes for irrigation (FOSS ET ALII 1990; FOSS 1989-90; FOSS 1992; TIMPSON ET ALII 1994; FOSS, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1996). As a consequence of Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s death, some others sites, which he had planned to be attractive and important, got no irrigation at all, thus their soil contains only a minimal quantity of extractable lead, about the same amount that is ordinarily found in modern agricultural fields.
Garden Peristyle-garden on the eastern side of the Republican villa (Fig. 1, n. 18)
Keywords  flower gardens nymphaea (garden structures) peristyles (Roman courtyards) porticoes  Garden Description This garden was set in the middle of a luxurious peristyle (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 335-337, fig. 116). Unluckily only its western part has been preserved. From what we find now on this side of the area, and from the ancient surveys showing the entire garden still existing in the XVIII cent., we can imagine how it must have looked. It was the kind which we call “hortus conclusus”, and it was enclosed by high walls decorated by a series of niches with semicircular ones alternating with square ones (Figg. 51; 52 and 53). Columns stood between them, and were set in the walls in such a way that only half of them emerged, looking as a sequence of half columns. Today only the groove left by them in the masonry, and the remains of the fine opus sectile which, once, covered the portico&amp;rsquo;s soil, allow us to imagine how it was decorated. At the two extremities of the western wall two very small nymphaea set in two narrow niches refreshed the air with their fountains (Fig. 51, a and b ). Apart from this today we can only see three large rooms, opening on the garden, which occupied the northern side of the peristyle. All the rest has been devastated by the agricultural exploitation of the land. Savage plowing and the destruction of both the portico and the enclosure to create ampler space for planting more olive trees and other crops, has caused landslides which have engulfed all the eastern part of this garden. Unluckily here there was no tufa platform to save the garden structure, and this is a pity, because this garden, connected with the Palace, must have been very interesting and the quantity of lead present in its soil shows that it was much cared for (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1994-95, fig. 7).

Villa Adriana, erected by emperor Hadrian at the beginning of the II cent. A.D., occupies a vast area of 126 hectares. It was a beautiful estate strategically located near Tivoli and, at the same time, not very far from Rome (WINNEFELD 1895; KÄHLER 1950; AURIGEMMA 1961; RAKOB 1973; BROWN 1964). Prior to the Hadrianic settlement, an ancient villa, dating back to the late republican time, already stood there. Probably it belonged to Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s family and, as a matter of fact, many scholars think that Hadrian chose this estate as the ideal one because he already knew the place and was attached to it (LUGLI 1927). Certainly he preserved and restored the original building and made it the nucleus of his private quarters.

This is the only way to explain how the works for its construction began immediately after his election and his return to Rome in 118 A.D.

Keywords  euripus terrace gardens  Garden Description This terrace, leaning to the North on a sustaining wall, is the first one of a series of very interesting overhanging gardens developing on successive sloping down terraces (Fig. 25). Up to now no flowerbeds have been discovered. Today we can only admire the very long euripus (Fig. 26), which was the principal feature of this garden (Fig. 25, A). It ran parallel to the buildings of the libraries and occupied all its northern front. At its extremities the euripus expanded in two octagonal basins which had flowerbeds at their centers (Fig. 26). Two other smaller basins decorated the garden (Fig. 25, B-C). We can see one in the photo (Fig. 27).

Garden The Belvedere of the Venus of Cnidus (Fig. 1, n. 11)
Keywords  exedrae (site elements) nymphaea (garden structures)  Garden Description This Belvedere is not really a garden. The area is all paved with luxurious opus sectile, and, therefore, there were no flowerbeds, but in every important park, beside bushes and blooming plants, there are always some elegant pavilions and exedras where one could pause and take a rest reading a book or talking with friends. Of course, you can&amp;rsquo;t have such a thing in small private house gardens where the area is restricted and all the space must be used for growing colorful blossoms. On the contrary in large extension of space they make necessary spots of interest where strollers can pause to enjoy the beauty of the thereabouts (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 388-390, fig. 139). The Belvedere of the Venus of Cnidus (Fig. 31) is one of them and it is also one of the most charming (ORTOLANI 1998). It was placed on a hillock overlooking the so-called Valley of Tempe. Two large exedras (Fig. 31, D) were laid on one of its sides; a round temple (Fig. 32) sheltering a copy of the Venus of Cnidus by Praxiteles stood at its center (Fig. 31, B), and, from it, the view ranged over Tivoli and the Appennine mountains in the background, really an enchanted place with a stunning view.
The Belvedere was created in those areas bought by Hadrian to have enough space to realize his project. Between it and the republican property ran a road that had deeply cut the tufa and to join the two parts Hadrian had to construct on the road a barrel vault to sustain the necessary soil (Fig. 33).

Location Description DESCRIPTION
Villa Adriana, erected by emperor Hadrian at the beginning of the II cent. A.D., occupies a vast area of 126 hectares. It was a beautiful estate strategically located near Tivoli and, at the same time, not very far from Rome (WINNEFELD 1895; KÄHLER 1950; AURIGEMMA 1961; RAKOB 1973; BROWN 1964). Prior to the Hadrianic settlement, an ancient villa, dating back to the late republican time, already stood there. Probably it belonged to Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s family and, as a matter of fact, many scholars think that Hadrian chose this estate as the ideal one because he already knew the place and was attached to it (LUGLI 1927). Certainly he preserved and restored the original building and made it the nucleus of his private quarters.
The realization of this magnificent residence must have been a cherished dream of Hadrian, and he must have planned it long before becoming an emperor. This is the only way to explain how the works for its construction began immediately after his election and his return to Rome in 118 A.D. Hadrian died in 138 A.D. when his ideal residence was nearly completed. Nearly, because there was still some work to be done. Some important halls of the Great Baths were not finished, and the model for a Stadium, found among the ruins of his last building-yard in the quarters of the stonecutters (CAPRINO 1996-97; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992-93, p. 73; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 144-147), was never brought to the unknown place where Hadrian had planned to build it. The Emperor&amp;rsquo;s death put an abrupt end to all activities, and some of the gardens he planned to create, and for which fountains and pavilions had already been built, were never done or, if ever they were completed, seem to have been soon abandoned (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992-93, pp. 000-000). As a matter of fact after him Villa Adriana was only partially lived in by his successors and was solely used for occasional visits. It became just one of the many country houses pertaining to the imperial praedia. Some of the existing gardens (Fig. 1), the ones nearer to the center of the residence and the monumental ones, were maintained and irrigated up to the end of the Roman Empire, a fact which is now proved by the concentration of extractable lead found in their soil, and which is due to the use of lead pipes for irrigation (FOSS ET ALII 1990; FOSS 1989-90; FOSS 1992; TIMPSON ET ALII 1994; FOSS, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1996). As a consequence of Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s death, some others sites, which he had planned to be attractive and important, got no irrigation at all, thus their soil contains only a minimal quantity of extractable lead, about the same amount that is ordinarily found in modern agricultural fields.
Garden The Canopus gardens (Fig. 1, n. 2) Canopus at Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s Villa (Pleiades)
Keywords  cisterns (plumbing components) columns (architectural elements) exedrae (site elements) flower gardens mosaics (visual works) porticoes statues canal  Garden Description The Canopus (Fig. 2 and 3) is perhaps the most important of all Villa Adriana&amp;rsquo;s gardens (JASHEMSKI, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1987-88, pp. 152-162, fig. 11-15; JASHEMSKI, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992, pp. 579-585, tavv. I-IV; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1998, pp. 374-383, fig. 9-13; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 323-324, fig. 80-81, 87, 134-135). It was set at the principal entrance through which Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s important guests were introduced when they came to visit the emperor. Thus the breathtaking view of the Canopus was the first impression visitors received entering this imperial residence. Their glance ran along the narrow valley set at the South side of Villa Adriana&amp;rsquo;s principal entry. An imposing waterway occupied all its length (Fig. 4). Columns and white marble statues reflected themselves in its blue water, and two statuary groups, both representing Scylla in the act of killing Ulysses&amp;rsquo; mates, emerged from the canal. It was here that Hadrian held his most important receptions and the banquets that, from time to time, he offered to his subjects (MART. 8.49; 9.91). As in ancient Rome dinner began around two o&amp;rsquo; clock p.m., and as, at this moment, the sun was still very high and very hot, a portico ran along the eastern bank offering its shade to those guests who had to dine on the sunny side (Fig. 2, A). On the opposite one, which was already protected by the hill, there was no portico (Fig. 2, B), but four beautiful copies of the Erecteum&amp;rsquo;s Caryatids and of two Sylens were set on the canal&amp;rsquo;s edge and were reflected on the water (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1987, pp. 175-178, figs. 13-20, 35-37). The spectacle was superb: the golden color of the portico&amp;rsquo;s columns, fashioned in the yellow marble of Shimtou, stood out against the green of the well-cut hedges of box-tree that bordered the lowest part of the valley (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000a), while high terraces rose at its two sides scaling the surrounding hills (Figg. 4 and 5) To complete the landscaping, a monumental exedra, (Fig. 6) and two elegant pavilion set at its sides (Figg. 2. D and D1 7) decorated the end of the valley (Fig. 2, C). In the old times the exedra was coated with polished marbles and multicolored mosaics. Some of its niches hosted imposing statues and large waterfalls flowed by other ones, while back, at the end of a central long gallery, a powerful cascade fed the outlying waterway (Fig. 2, E). Nothing could have been more pleasant and at the same time more imposing than the Canopus.
Then excavations in the valley showed the existence of two long flower beds that were set on the two side of the canal (Fig. 8) and in them both we and the Danish archaeologists found amphoras cut in two and with large holes on their sides to let the plant kept in them to branch their roots in the soil and remain strong and flourishing. Our probes are marked on the plan (Fig 2. m; n; o; p; q).

As a consequence of Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s death, some others sites, which he had planned to be attractive and important, got no irrigation at all, thus their soil contains only a minimal quantity of extractable lead, about the same amount that is ordinarily found in modern agricultural fields.
Garden The garden between the Small Baths and the Three Exedras Hall (Fig. 1, n. 5)
Keywords  flower gardens fountains garden pavilions nymphaea (garden structures) peristyles (Roman courtyards) piazza porticoes stadium triclinia tufa  Garden Description It has already been cited in the precedent Jashemski-Ricotti article but only very sketchily (JASHEMSKI, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1987-88, pp. 149-150, fig. 3). Today the finding of the enormous amount of lead in its soil (1234 mg/kg) (Fig. 17) has created a new interest in it (FOSS 1989-90; FOSS 1992; FOSS, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1996; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1998, pp. 368-370, fig. 3; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 331-334, figs. 114-115). It proves that this plot of land was exploited for a very long time starting from the earlier republican era. Probably at those times a huge reservoir existed there and the land was kept as an orchard. Later on, just before the end of the I cent. B.C., it must have been transformed in a garden (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1994-95, p. 78, fig. 5) and the front of this cistern was decorated by an elegant nymphaeum (Figg. 18 and 19). In Hadrianic times the baths displaced the water reserve, but the nymphaeum was preserved. It must have been a particularly fine and elegant monument if Hadrian decided to save it and made it an important part of his new garden arrangement. The Augustan water-theater consisted of a 19.50 m long façade, adorned by two low basins, which stretched out from semielliptical niches (PENNA 1831, p. 59, fig. 59). We still see in them two low pedestals, evidently built to sustain some fountain statues. Other statues must have occupied the three square niches framed by small columns, which, set at a level of 1.84 m from the soil, flanked the basins&amp;rsquo; ones. The big piscina limaria, that supplied the two thermae, replaced the ancient reservoir and furnished large quantities of water. It soaked the ground and allowed the cultivation of plants that had to be frequently and abundantly watered. It is evident that only an uninterrupted irrigation delivered for at least eight centuries through leaden pipes could deposit in the soil such a high concentration of this metal.

Location Description DESCRIPTION
Villa Adriana, erected by emperor Hadrian at the beginning of the II cent. A.D., occupies a vast area of 126 hectares. It was a beautiful estate strategically located near Tivoli and, at the same time, not very far from Rome (WINNEFELD 1895; KÄHLER 1950; AURIGEMMA 1961; RAKOB 1973; BROWN 1964). Prior to the Hadrianic settlement, an ancient villa, dating back to the late republican time, already stood there. Probably it belonged to Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s family and, as a matter of fact, many scholars think that Hadrian chose this estate as the ideal one because he already knew the place and was attached to it (LUGLI 1927). Certainly he preserved and restored the original building and made it the nucleus of his private quarters.
The realization of this magnificent residence must have been a cherished dream of Hadrian, and he must have planned it long before becoming an emperor. This is the only way to explain how the works for its construction began immediately after his election and his return to Rome in 118 A.D. Hadrian died in 138 A.D. when his ideal residence was nearly completed. Nearly, because there was still some work to be done. Some important halls of the Great Baths were not finished, and the model for a Stadium, found among the ruins of his last building-yard in the quarters of the stonecutters (CAPRINO 1996-97; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992-93, p. 73; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 144-147), was never brought to the unknown place where Hadrian had planned to build it. The Emperor&amp;rsquo;s death put an abrupt end to all activities, and some of the gardens he planned to create, and for which fountains and pavilions had already been built, were never done or, if ever they were completed, seem to have been soon abandoned (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992-93, pp. 000-000). As a matter of fact after him Villa Adriana was only partially lived in by his successors and was solely used for occasional visits. It became just one of the many country houses pertaining to the imperial praedia. Some of the existing gardens (Fig. 1), the ones nearer to the center of the residence and the monumental ones, were maintained and irrigated up to the end of the Roman Empire, a fact which is now proved by the concentration of extractable lead found in their soil, and which is due to the use of lead pipes for irrigation (FOSS ET ALII 1990; FOSS 1989-90; FOSS 1992; TIMPSON ET ALII 1994; FOSS, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1996). As a consequence of Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s death, some others sites, which he had planned to be attractive and important, got no irrigation at all, thus their soil contains only a minimal quantity of extractable lead, about the same amount that is ordinarily found in modern agricultural fields.

Garden Description Here only the considerable presence of lead in the soil denounces the existence of an ancient garden (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1994-95, fig. 7). It is clear that this space, which was the point of arrival of the most important guests coming to dine with the emperor, must have been elegantly arranged. At its same level we can still admire some luxurious guestrooms with superb marble floorings. It stands to reason that the area around them must have been well planned and well kept.

Garden The Garden of the Piazza d&amp;rsquo;Oro (Fig. 1, n. 20) Piazza d&amp;rsquo;Oro at Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s Villa (Pleiades)
Keywords  flower gardens peristyles (Roman courtyards) porticoes  Garden Description The garden of the Piazza d&amp;rsquo;Oro is one of the most prestigious and interesting of Villa Adriana. It consists of a peristyle garden set amid a double portico and surrounded by some of the most elegant buildings of this imperial residence (Figg. 54 and 55). The garden, which occupies the central part of the peristyle, was probed in 1987. Afterwards, in 1988, with the sponsorship of Dumbarton Oaks and the help of the Latium Superintendence, it was partially excavated (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1987, pp. 180-181, figs. 29-34; JASHEMSKI, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1987-88, pp. 162-169, figs. 16-22; JASHEMSKI, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992, pp. 585-595, figs. 8-17; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1998, pp. 370-374, figs. 4-8; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 339-354, figs. 117-126). Here the nearly surfacing platform of tufa was a great help to find where the flowerbeds were and how the garden was arranged (Fig. 56). The first thing that was discovered was a double line of deep holes, m 1.80 long, 0.90 wide and 1.20 deep which circled all the area (Fig. 56, f). Their size proved that they were meant for trees, but which ones? As we didn&amp;rsquo;t find any seeds, pollens or roots to help us in identifying them, we must rely on what was written in ancient texts. From Pliny we know that in their gardens Romans used cypresses (PLIN. nat. 16.60.139-141; PLIN. epist. 5.6.16-17), plane trees (PLIN. nat. 12.3-5), pine trees, pomegranates, oleanders, laurels (PLIN. nat. 15.49.197) and, at the end of the Republic, even lemon trees (PLIN. nat. 1.15-16; see JASHEMSKI 1979, pp. 77-79).
These indications have been confirmed by the studies that Prof. Jashemski carried out in Pompeii, Herculaneum and other places (JASHEMSKI 1979, passim; 1993, passim). Of all the trees listed by the great naturalist we must immediately discard cypresses, as the ones that Pliny the Younger described in the hippodrome-garden of his Tuscany villa (PLIN. epist. 5.6.32-40). Also if those trees could be cut in shapes suited to the garden&amp;rsquo;s design by topiary artists and could be very decorative, their foliage begins at a very low level and the trees tend to be very high, thus they are very good for fencing an enclosure, but here, at the Piazza d&amp;rsquo;Oro, where the garden was planned to be seen from the surrounding porticoes, they would have completely hidden it. Thereupon we must revert to more convenient trees or bushes, like laurels, which grow very well in the area and whose foliage could be kept very high, in such a way that the trees would not hide the view, or like the ever present box tree (PLIN. nat. 16.28.70) which could be cut in conveniently low green hedges. Flowering bushes and, maybe, Pliny&amp;rsquo;s violets (PLIN. nat. 21.14 and 47) set in decorative designs could have grown in the central part of the garden. In the middle of the area a beautiful white marble euripus, set between the entrance hall, on one side, and the tricliniar pavilion with all its fountains, on the other (Fig. 56, m), reflected the encircling buildings with their polished walls. The view must have been very similar to the scene we now admire on the water of the Taj Mahal&amp;rsquo;s canal at Agra.
Entering in the Piazza d’Oro the ancient garden extends itself before our view (Fig. 57). It is not a garden anymore but we can detect his planning by the structure that are still surfacing and it is stunning. Also fascinating is the spectacle we enjoy looking from the pavilion at the distant domed entrance hall. The large euripus, once all lined by white marble, is displayed before us (Fig. 58): We can easily imagine how, when the building was new and probably resplendent in its revetments, its marbles and all the refined decorations, its view would have been reflected in the limpid cana giving us the same effect that today we can enjoy visiting the Taj Mahal at Agra.
But there were not only the beauty and the refinement that appealed to us at the Piazza d’Oro. Very interesting was discovering all the gardening technics applied in it. Fascinating for instance was the watering system we found in the Piazza d&amp;rsquo;Oro garden (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1989-90). There were two canals each circling half o the garden. Te western one running 60 cm under the soil infiltrated directly at this level water in canal cut in the tufa and covered by masonry vaults (Fig. 59). The irrigation seeped directly in the garden canals through low rectangular cuts opened in the tufa (Fig. 60). All the flowerbeds had those canals, well cut and done by an accurate team of gardeners (Fig. 61). With this system as a consequence of the phenomenon of capillarity, every time the surface dried, the moisture rose up from the bottom and watered the roots of the plants; thus there was not even the loss of the good elements contained in the soil. Then, when the irrigation went on, little by little the soil, contained at the bottom of these trenches, became very soaked and water ran quickly toward the drainage canal. As a simple sluice, set at the start of the irrigation canal (Fig. 62), controlled all this system. To water nearly all the area a single man had only to lift it, and the same man could with a simple movement close the sluice when the soil didn’t absorb more water.
Then when it was closed and all the water furnished by the pavilion fountains went to the eastern canal.
Here there was a different way to water the plants. Due to their inclination the canals were too deep for the capillarity, but all the same were still continued for letting them to reach the drainage canal. Thus in the eastern part of the garden a very old system was used, one that we find in Pasagarde, the splendid Cyrus park. Here marble lined canals joined a series of cubic basins. In the Piazza d’Oro the eastern canal, that in ancient times was completely covered by a vault, but that now for a spell lays in the open, had many little pits excavated in its bottom (Fig. 63). Over each one of them was placed a pump. Probably bronze ones that were pillaged in the middle age at the time of the “metals hunger”. The breaks in the canal’s vault (Fig. 56, p) seems to confirm this hypothesis.

As a consequence of Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s death, some others sites, which he had planned to be attractive and important, got no irrigation at all, thus their soil contains only a minimal quantity of extractable lead, about the same amount that is ordinarily found in modern agricultural fields.

Keywords  tombs  Garden Description We always find open spaces around the more important tombs and we know that they were kept as gardens. Just last summer Prof. Foss analyzed the samples drawn from the enclosure of the tomb of Romulus, Massenzio&amp;rsquo;s son, on the Appian way, and found a large quantity of lead in it, lead that was not found in other parts of this emperor&amp;rsquo;s villa, as in its famed Circus (Fig. 64). It is evident that the area around this tomb was kept as a garden and that it was watered for quite a long period. Of the garden around the tomb found on the back of the Piazza d&amp;rsquo;Oro we can only say that, as the Romulus tomb, it was set in a very large enclosure. Lead was present but not in very large quantity (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1994-95, fig. 7), thus it must have been set with big trees and bushes that didn&amp;rsquo;t need much irrigation If tufa is present here as in the nearby garden, and if ever the Tomb&amp;rsquo;s area will be excavated, we probably might find the same kind of arrangements for planting trees as in the Piazza d&amp;rsquo;Oro.

Location Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s Villa (Pleiades)
Location Description DESCRIPTION
Villa Adriana, erected by emperor Hadrian at the beginning of the II cent. A.D., occupies a vast area of 126 hectares. It was a beautiful estate strategically located near Tivoli and, at the same time, not very far from Rome (WINNEFELD 1895; KÄHLER 1950; AURIGEMMA 1961; RAKOB 1973; BROWN 1964). Prior to the Hadrianic settlement, an ancient villa, dating back to the late republican time, already stood there. Probably it belonged to Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s family and, as a matter of fact, many scholars think that Hadrian chose this estate as the ideal one because he already knew the place and was attached to it (LUGLI 1927). Certainly he preserved and restored the original building and made it the nucleus of his private quarters.
The realization of this magnificent residence must have been a cherished dream of Hadrian, and he must have planned it long before becoming an emperor. This is the only way to explain how the works for its construction began immediately after his election and his return to Rome in 118 A.D. Hadrian died in 138 A.D. when his ideal residence was nearly completed. Nearly, because there was still some work to be done. Some important halls of the Great Baths were not finished, and the model for a Stadium, found among the ruins of his last building-yard in the quarters of the stonecutters (CAPRINO 1996-97; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992-93, p. 73; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 144-147), was never brought to the unknown place where Hadrian had planned to build it. The Emperor&amp;rsquo;s death put an abrupt end to all activities, and some of the gardens he planned to create, and for which fountains and pavilions had already been built, were never done or, if ever they were completed, seem to have been soon abandoned (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992-93, pp. 000-000). As a matter of fact after him Villa Adriana was only partially lived in by his successors and was solely used for occasional visits. It became just one of the many country houses pertaining to the imperial praedia. Some of the existing gardens (Fig. 1), the ones nearer to the center of the residence and the monumental ones, were maintained and irrigated up to the end of the Roman Empire, a fact which is now proved by the concentration of extractable lead found in their soil, and which is due to the use of lead pipes for irrigation (FOSS ET ALII 1990; FOSS 1989-90; FOSS 1992; TIMPSON ET ALII 1994; FOSS, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1996). As a consequence of Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s death, some others sites, which he had planned to be attractive and important, got no irrigation at all, thus their soil contains only a minimal quantity of extractable lead, about the same amount that is ordinarily found in modern agricultural fields.
Garden The gardens at the entrance of Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s villa (Fig. 1, n. 3)
Keywords  flower gardens peristyles (Roman courtyards) tufa  Garden Description The Great Entrance Hall of Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s villa (Fig. 9) presents three gardens, two of which (Fig. 9, A and G) are peristyle ones.
a – The main gate to the Hadrianic residence opens up on a peristyle garden, the largest one. Having just been excavated by Dr. Anna Maria Reggiani, the Latium&amp;rsquo;s Superintendent, it is published by her at p. 000 .
b –The other garden (Figs. 9, G, and 10-11), set at the eastern side of the entrance hall, occupies a smaller peristyle with a curved side toward East (REICHARDT 1933). It was crossed in the middle by a path which had a round-shaped space in the center (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1987, pp. 175-178, figs. 13-20; JASHEMSKI, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1987-88, p. 147, figs. 1-2; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1998, pp. 364-366, fig. 1; MARI, REGGIANI, RIGHI 2000; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 323-324, fig. 110). Here some decorative element - a marble vase or a statue - was probably displayed. Two flowerbeds cut in the tufa flanked it (Figs. 10, G, and 11). We are still pretty sure that they were bordered by well-groomed box hedges, a kind of decoration which was afterwards inherited by the “all&amp;rsquo;italiana” system of landscaping. This fashion, widely employed in many outstanding examples of Renaissance gardens, is still in use nowadays. The presence of well cut green hedges bordering those ancient flowerbeds was a must and it is a sure fact that they existed here, but we know very little about the rest. For instance, what, if anything, could have been set in their central part? Prof. Jashemski found pollen, seeds, roots of flowering bushes and of some trees in her Pompeian gardens, but here at Villa Adriana nothing was left in the ground. We are bound to follow our imagination. Of course there could have been grass in the center of the flowerbeds as well as masses of blossoms. If the latter was the case - but, looking to “all&amp;rsquo;italiana” gardens, which are basically green gardens, I highly doubt it - the flowers should have been the kinds which were in fashion in ancient Roman times. In his Natural History (nat. 21.10), Pliny the Older explained that Romans didn&amp;rsquo;t use many of them. In their gardens they mainly planted roses and violets. However we must keep in mind that, for Pliny, the word violets meant every kind of small herbaceous species that could produce colored blossoms. He catalogued many kinds of them as the yellow, the purple, and the white kind, and it is highly probable that they must have been pimpernels as well as hyacinths and, of course real violets too. It is, however, evident that any of these plants could create gay clusters of blossoms in the center of a flowerbed and that they could make a very appealing garden.
c – The third garden of the Great Entrance Hall occupies its extreme western part (REICHARDT 1933, pp. 129-130). Here an unpaved courtyard circled a small temple, probably dedicated to the Imperial Lares (Fig. 9, L). The flowerbeds have still to be excavated, but, as in all the Great Entrance Hall&amp;rsquo;s area the tufa is practically surfacing, this must happen also here. Therefore it is highly probable that an excavation will bring to light the flowerbeds cut in the rock for the plants.

Keywords  flower gardens nymphaea (garden structures) peristyles (Roman courtyards) porticoes  Garden Description This garden belongs to the republican period and it is one of the most ancient of Villa Adriana. It is enclosed in a large peristyle 48 m wide, 72 m long. The place seems to have been watered from the Republican time up to the end of the Roman Empire, and the content of lead in its soil is among the highest in the area (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1994-95, fig. 7). At the center of the portico&amp;rsquo;s northern side, there still is a republican nymphaeum with a rectangular plan and very thick walls: a vaulted hall decorated with a series of niches, but quite heavy and gloomy (Fig. 35, E). There must have been flowerbeds in the peristyle, but the garden has still to be excavated. Now an olive grove occupies the place, and I doubt that anybody would dare to cut it down. However, if this would ever happen, we must hope to ascertain the presence of tufa surfacing in this area and, thus, find the hole cut in the rock to create the flowerbeds. It would be the only way to discover how the place had been planned.

Some important halls of the Great Baths were not finished, and the model for a Stadium, found among the ruins of his last building-yard in the quarters of the stonecutters (CAPRINO 1996-97; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992-93, p. 73; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 144-147), was never brought to the unknown place where Hadrian had planned to build it.

As a matter of fact after him Villa Adriana was only partially lived in by his successors and was solely used for occasional visits. It became just one of the many country houses pertaining to the imperial praedia. Some of the existing gardens (Fig. 1), the ones nearer to the center of the residence and the monumental ones, were maintained and irrigated up to the end of the Roman Empire, a fact which is now proved by the concentration of extractable lead found in their soil, and which is due to the use of lead pipes for irrigation (FOSS ET ALII 1990; FOSS 1989-90; FOSS 1992; TIMPSON ET ALII 1994; FOSS, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1996). As a consequence of Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s death, some others sites, which he had planned to be attractive and important, got no irrigation at all, thus their soil contains only a minimal quantity of extractable lead, about the same amount that is ordinarily found in modern agricultural fields.
Garden The Pecile (Fig. 1, n. 6) Pecile at Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s Villa (Pleiades)
Keywords  columns (architectural elements) flower gardens peristyles (Roman courtyards) porticoes tufa  Garden Description The Pecile (Fig. 20) was never excavated as a garden. Thus, today, we have only the large pond, 30 m wide x 116 m long (Fig. 21) which hosts a flock of white geese (Fig. 20, A). A garden must have been spread all around it, but its flowerbeds need still to be investigated (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 139-141, fig. 45). If, as in Villa Adriana often happens, they have been dug in the tufa platform, sooner or later we will be able to see their shapes and reconstruct the garden&amp;rsquo;s appearance. For the moment we have to be content with the dark green bushes which, cut in the shape of columns, mark the spots once occupied by the ones of the monumental peristyle 100 m wide and 248 m long. On the northern side of the Pecile, we can still admire the long wall around which, once, ran the double portico used by the Emperor for his daily strolls (Fig. 20, B): three spins around the central wall corresponded to a mile as written on a marble slate (HÜLSEN 1896; MANCINI 1952; COARELLI 1997, pp. 207-209). He could circle around it as many times as his doctor had prescribed him to do (Fig. 22). According to ancient Romans&amp;rsquo; belief, long walks offered an opportunity to exercise and were necessary to preserve both health and fitness. At the western end of the Pecile, a pillared Belvedere offered to Villa Adriana&amp;rsquo;s inhabitants the possibility to rest from time to time admiring the underlying plain and the city of Rome far away on the horizon.

Location Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s Villa (Pleiades)
Location Description DESCRIPTION
Villa Adriana, erected by emperor Hadrian at the beginning of the II cent. A.D., occupies a vast area of 126 hectares. It was a beautiful estate strategically located near Tivoli and, at the same time, not very far from Rome (WINNEFELD 1895; KÄHLER 1950; AURIGEMMA 1961; RAKOB 1973; BROWN 1964). Prior to the Hadrianic settlement, an ancient villa, dating back to the late republican time, already stood there. Probably it belonged to Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s family and, as a matter of fact, many scholars think that Hadrian chose this estate as the ideal one because he already knew the place and was attached to it (LUGLI 1927). Certainly he preserved and restored the original building and made it the nucleus of his private quarters.
The realization of this magnificent residence must have been a cherished dream of Hadrian, and he must have planned it long before becoming an emperor. This is the only way to explain how the works for its construction began immediately after his election and his return to Rome in 118 A.D. Hadrian died in 138 A.D. when his ideal residence was nearly completed. Nearly, because there was still some work to be done. Some important halls of the Great Baths were not finished, and the model for a Stadium, found among the ruins of his last building-yard in the quarters of the stonecutters (CAPRINO 1996-97; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992-93, p. 73; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 144-147), was never brought to the unknown place where Hadrian had planned to build it. The Emperor&amp;rsquo;s death put an abrupt end to all activities, and some of the gardens he planned to create, and for which fountains and pavilions had already been built, were never done or, if ever they were completed, seem to have been soon abandoned (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992-93, pp. 000-000).

It became just one of the many country houses pertaining to the imperial praedia. Some of the existing gardens (Fig. 1), the ones nearer to the center of the residence and the monumental ones, were maintained and irrigated up to the end of the Roman Empire, a fact which is now proved by the concentration of extractable lead found in their soil, and which is due to the use of lead pipes for irrigation (FOSS ET ALII 1990; FOSS 1989-90; FOSS 1992; TIMPSON ET ALII 1994; FOSS, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1996). As a consequence of Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s death, some others sites, which he had planned to be attractive and important, got no irrigation at all, thus their soil contains only a minimal quantity of extractable lead, about the same amount that is ordinarily found in modern agricultural fields.
Garden The so-called Inferi Nymphaeum (Fig. 1, n. 23)
Keywords  fountains nymphaea (garden structures)  Garden Description The so-called Inferi (Figg. 68 and 69) is a garden arrangement placed a little South of the tomb and closely connected with the building called the “Temple of Pluto” set just East of it. This peculiar landscaping arrangement was created excavating a narrow artificial valley in the slopes of the grounds that here are climbing up towards the Santo Stefano Hill, while the Inferi’s garden went down to rejoin the same level of the underground carriages&amp;rsquo; road, which, as a modern subway, connected all the buildings of Villa Adriana (MACDONALD, PINTO 1995, pp. 143-145; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1998, pp. 390-395, figs. 18-19; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 303-305, figs. 25, 138). The small vale, 128 m long and 17 m wide, terminated, at its southern extremity, in a dark grotto 5.10 m wide and 7.20 m deep (Fig. 68, P). At the end of the small cave a narrow cleaving (Fig. 68, A) not even 40-30 cm large and diminishing all the time, is all that is left of an ancient fountain (Fig.70). At Contini&amp;rsquo;s time the grotto must have been nearly filled by soil and so it still was in the XIX century as we can see in a Penna drawing (Fig. 71), However Contini could have seen only the top of the Inferi. This can explain why the Roman 17nth century architect traced an inexistent gallery connecting the small nymphaeum with the trapezoidal system of large galleries which served as parking place and stables to the Great Underground Carriage Road. Contini, impressed by Aelius Spartianus&amp;rsquo; assertion “etiam Inferos finxit” (Hist. Aug., Hadr. 26.5), believed that all the gigantic underground parts of this area were a representation of the afterlife. Thus he supposed that a gallery must have connected with this antrum - which he thought to be the entrance of the reign of Pluto - with the Great Trapeze.
In reality the Inferi Nymphaeum, as any other part of Villa Adriana, was only linked to the underground road. A gallery starting from the middle of the eastern semicircular tunnel (Fig. 68, L) connected the little valley, and indirectly also the building called “Pluto&amp;rsquo;s Temple”, to the subterranean communication route (Fig. 68, E).
Today the small glen, which from 1969 on and through all 1972 was kept free of vegetation, has just been cleaned, and a kind of wild jungle, that developed in it during the last 30 years, has been uprooted. It needs badly to be excavated and the findings will certainly be rewarding. To begin with it is probable that an euripus will be found in its middle. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that, on both sides of the valley and just 16.50 m before the grotto, we find the openings of the two semicircular galleries leading to the nymphaeum (Fig. 68, B-C). One of them was surely necessary because from its middle started the gallery connecting it with the Great Underground Carriage Road; but the only objective of the other one (Fig. 68, C) was to reach the grotto. Why? If there had not been any hindrance anyone could have gotten there through the vale or, in case of a basin barring the entrance, even through the eastern gallery. There was no need of a second one. Thus this fact points up that:
1 - the access to the Nymphaeum must have been barred, probably by a basin (Fig. 68, H);
2 - a canal running up from the Nymphaeum to the end of the valley (Fig. 68, G) must have divided two sidewalks set on both sides of the small valley. Only this could create the necessity of a second gallery to connect the grotto with the western side of the dale.
Romans, as we know, never did anything unnecessary just for symmetry&amp;rsquo;s sake. Hadrian who along the canal of the Canopus valley set a portico only where it was needed to protects the diners from the sun and not on the other bank which was already shaded by the hill, would never create an underground symmetrical gallery which could be admired only on a map. Moreover the presence of a canal in the middle of the valley seems to be confirmed by a probe conducted with an auger which found a difference of 0.50 m of depth between the sides of the valley and its center.
Coming back to the small cave, this grotto is surely what Aelius Spartianus called Inferi when he wrote “etiam Inferos finxit”. The tight connection of it with the mysterious building known with different names - Elysian Fields (Ligorio), Serapis Temple (Piranesi), Pluto&amp;rsquo;s Temple (Penna) - when compared in the same scale with the Telesterion and the nearby Plutonium of Eleusis (Fig. 67) might suggest that this creation was contrived by Hadrian as a memento of the Eleusinian mysteries to which, he had been initiated, and in which he also reached the highest degree.

Garden The so-called Throne Hall garden (Fig. 1, n. 17)
Keywords  flower gardens nymphaea (garden structures) peristyles (Roman courtyards)  Garden Description The so-called “Throne Hall” (MACDONALD, PINTO 1995, pp. 78-81), was not a throne hall at all (Fig. 46). It was a garden (JASHEMSKI, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1987-88, pp. 154-156, figs. 9-10; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1998, p. 366, fig. 2; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 325-330, figs. 111-113). A probe (Fig. 46, A), in the peristyle cleared that here there was no flooring. Another probe (Fig. 46, B), revealed instead the existence of two flowerbeds (Fig. 46, C), dug in the tufa, and enclosed by low walls of irregular blocks of stone, roughly set together by a poor mortar. Even a small flowerpot was found in the northern flowerbed (Fig. 47). By its small size and its shape, it revealed to have contained some small plant of the kind called by Pliny “viola”(Fig. 48). The garden was crossed in the middle by a central alley: a large path (Fig. 46, P) that led to a podium (Fig. 46, S) set in an ample apse. Today both these two elements are in very bad condition The remains of the apse are scarcely higher than the basis of a series of niches, which - Penna says - were decorated by chunks of pumice tinged with green and bluish hues to imitate the grottoes&amp;rsquo; rocky walls, a typical decoration for a garden nymphaeum. Today the podium, that was set in the middle of the apse, is quite wrecked. Once it must have been lined with marble but today only the concrete of its basement is left (Fig. 49).
However the presence of the podium and the fragments of the red marble suggests that all this arrangement was created to expose some particularly beautiful piece of sculpture. As a matter of fact, chunks of a red marble statue (a Faun&amp;rsquo;s tail, and a piece of a goat&amp;rsquo;s skin) have been found here. This suggests the presence of a third statue of Faun with a goat, similar to the two that have already been found at Villa Adriana. Unfortunately, the way in which the remains have been broken, and the vicinity of some kilns where many pieces of sculpture were reduced to chalk, makes us think that nothing more will be found. It is a pity, because this statue, probably brought back by the emperor&amp;rsquo;s in 125 A.D., must have been an outstanding piece of sculpture.
It is evident that this peristyle-garden was clearly designed to give a scenographic view of the masterwork (Fig. 50) to people staying in the Doric Pilasters&amp;rsquo; Hall.

Location Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s Villa (Pleiades)
Location Description DESCRIPTION
Villa Adriana, erected by emperor Hadrian at the beginning of the II cent. A.D., occupies a vast area of 126 hectares. It was a beautiful estate strategically located near Tivoli and, at the same time, not very far from Rome (WINNEFELD 1895; KÄHLER 1950; AURIGEMMA 1961; RAKOB 1973; BROWN 1964). Prior to the Hadrianic settlement, an ancient villa, dating back to the late republican time, already stood there. Probably it belonged to Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s family and, as a matter of fact, many scholars think that Hadrian chose this estate as the ideal one because he already knew the place and was attached to it (LUGLI 1927). Certainly he preserved and restored the original building and made it the nucleus of his private quarters.
The realization of this magnificent residence must have been a cherished dream of Hadrian, and he must have planned it long before becoming an emperor. This is the only way to explain how the works for its construction began immediately after his election and his return to Rome in 118 A.D. Hadrian died in 138 A.D. when his ideal residence was nearly completed. Nearly, because there was still some work to be done. Some important halls of the Great Baths were not finished, and the model for a Stadium, found among the ruins of his last building-yard in the quarters of the stonecutters (CAPRINO 1996-97; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992-93, p. 73; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 144-147), was never brought to the unknown place where Hadrian had planned to build it. The Emperor&amp;rsquo;s death put an abrupt end to all activities, and some of the gardens he planned to create, and for which fountains and pavilions had already been built, were never done or, if ever they were completed, seem to have been soon abandoned (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992-93, pp. 000-000). As a matter of fact after him Villa Adriana was only partially lived in by his successors and was solely used for occasional visits. It became just one of the many country houses pertaining to the imperial praedia. Some of the existing gardens (Fig. 1), the ones nearer to the center of the residence and the monumental ones, were maintained and irrigated up to the end of the Roman Empire, a fact which is now proved by the concentration of extractable lead found in their soil, and which is due to the use of lead pipes for irrigation (FOSS ET ALII 1990; FOSS 1989-90; FOSS 1992; TIMPSON ET ALII 1994; FOSS, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1996). As a consequence of Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s death, some others sites, which he had planned to be attractive and important, got no irrigation at all, thus their soil contains only a minimal quantity of extractable lead, about the same amount that is ordinarily found in modern agricultural fields.
Garden The Stadium-garden (Fig. 1, n. 4) Stadium-garden at Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s Villa (Pleiades)
Keywords  flower gardens fountains garden pavilions nymphaea (garden structures) peristyles (Roman courtyards) piazza porticoes stadium triclinia tufa  Garden Description Already widely documented, published and discussed, it was surveyed, excavated and reconstructed by A. Hoffman (HOFFMAN 1980). His book is an outstanding and very important work but we can&amp;rsquo;t accept all of his hypotheses, and namely we can&amp;rsquo;t believe the existence of an impossible central basin (HOFFMAN 1980, p. 67, plt. 50. 1). The place, picked for it by Hoffman, is a square area where tufa is surfacing (Fig. 12, d). All the excavations put in evidence that only a thin layer of soil (10 to 5 cm high) covered the rock (JASHEMSKI, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1987-88, pp. 151-154, fig. 4; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1998, pp. 383-385, fig. 14). Now it stands to reason that, if there had been a basin, it must have had a decorative coating of marble or mosaic. In this case the tufa would have been first smoothed and after that leveled with a thick layer of mortar. But there is no trace of leveling or of mortar here. The surface of the rock is irregular and left as it was in nature. It is difficult to understand how, with this kind of rocks nearly surfacing, anybody could have imagined to find the depth necessary to create a basin. How didn&amp;rsquo;t he calculate the thickness of the layer of concrete necessary to create a horizontal smooth plane, which, as the higher peaks of the rock were at 5 cm from the soil&amp;rsquo;s surface, had to be 6 cm thick at least? How didn&amp;rsquo;t he realize that, to keep the water in, he had to spread over the concrete a layer of at least 2 cm of impervious opus signinum? Then he had to cover it with another layer of mortar necessary for fixing the chosen flooring, and at last, add from 1 to 3 cm of mosaic or marble. There would never have been any place left, not even for enough water to moisten the surface.
Therefore what we find here is simply a piazza 20 m long and 23.75 m wide (Fig. 12, d). It is placed right in the middle of the so-called Stadium (Figg. 14-15), a garden which is the pivotal part of a very important tricliniar area (Fig. 13) (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1987, pp. 178-180, figs. 21-28, 35-37); consisting in the Three Exedras&amp;rsquo; Hall (Fig. 12, a and e). It stood on its western side, and the overhanging Winter Palace, which rose on the opposite one (Fig. 12, b). In the Stadium, two large tricliniar pavilions (Fig. 12, c, c1) were set at the southern and northern side of the piazza (Fig. 14 and 15) (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 225-231). Due to its position, this place was conveniently set under the eyes of all the guests. It was their center of interest.
Now, for what we read about Roman everyday life, we know that, while banqueting, people used to enjoy many forms of entertainment (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1983, passim) and, from the Historia Augusta, we also know that, during his dinners, Hadrian always wanted to assist to comedies, dramas and recitals of poetry (Hist. Aug., Hadr. 25.20). Therefore it seems highly probable that this area was intended to be used as a stage, even though not a paved one, because here there are no remains of masonry. We must conclude that its soil was either covered by a layer of very fine red gravel (remains of it were found in the excavation of the Stadium-garden) or - even if there is no knowledge of the existence in ancient times of grasses kept as a kind of lawn - of a green space (Fig. 12, d).
Meanwhile on the northern end of the Stadium the area between three luxurious rooms (Fig.12, n) and the tricliniar pavilion was occupied by a small, elegant garden (Figg. 12, m; 14). Porticoes (Fig. 12, s) ran on both its sides and, in the middle, two square and long flowerbeds flanked a marble lined euripus. We can very well imagine the reflection of the architecture on its calm blue water.
On the opposite side (Figg. 12, H; 16), another garden - an emicycle - imitated the part which, in a real Stadium, was occupied by the public. Only this one was a magnificent nymphaeum (HOFFMAN 1980, pp. 000-000). A canalization, coasting the palace building, circled the top of the emicycle, and water slided from it on the white marble steps of eight small waterfalls. Amid them, hedges of box trees, neatly cut, well groomed, and set in big mortar containers, took the place of the spectators&amp;rsquo; seats. At the bottom, in a small grotto, a fountain collected the falling water, and emptied it in the nearby semicircular basin, concluding with it this splendid water-theater. A spectacular garden indeed.

Garden The terrace on the valley of Tempe (Fig. 1, n. 10)
Keywords  terrace gardens  Garden Description This terrace offers a splendid view of Tivoli and its mountains (Fig. 30). The concentration of lead in its soil shows that it was kept as a cultivated area (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1994-95, fig. 7). Today we don&amp;rsquo;t have enough elements to understand its landscaping, but we must consider that the terrace is set between two very important garden features of Villa Adriana. On the northern side it is flanked by the enchanting, open air pavilion now called the “Belvedere of the Venus of Cnidus” (Fig. 1, 11) while, on the opposite side of the plateau, another imposing nymphaeum, the so-called “Stallone”, concludes the esplanade overlooking the Valley of Tempe. At the back of this terrace a big sustaining wall reinforced by impressive arches ran along the West side, and this embankment was concluded by another more modest nymphaeum, set in front of the Venus of Cnidus&amp;rsquo; Belvedere. It was decorated by a series of niches which, before the ruin of Villa Adriana, might have contained some decorative elements, giving this garden its final touch. Today the niches have been disfigured opening , in each of them, windows of different shapes the ones from the others.

      <description>Province Africa Proconsularis (Pleiades)
Province Description The history of Roman Africa begins in 146 BC with the destruction of Carthage and the establishment of the province of Africa in the most fertile part of the Carthaginian Empire. The new province covered about 5000 square miles (17,172 square kilometers) of the northern part of modern Tunisia. A praetor governed the area from his headquarters at Utica. The Romans inherited a thriving agriculture developed by the Carthaginians. The climate was hospitable. Wheat and barley were the most important cereals; wine and olive oil were also produced and there were various fruit trees.
Location [THUBURBO MAIUS (Henchir Kasbat), Tunisia (Pleiades)
Location Description The city occupies the slopes of a hill in a fertile grain producing area about 50 kilometers to the south of Tunis. Originally a settlement of mercenary soldiers after the fall of Carthage, it was raised to amunicipium by Hadrian (117-138), and to a colony during therein of Commodus (177-192). The chief public buildings and the most beautiful homes date from this period. After the crisis of the Empire during the third century, Thuburbo saw a rebirth in the fourth century; but as imperial authority declined the city became a mere village.
Keywords  peristyle (Roman courtyards) portico  Garden Description This building, located to the NW of the Winter Baths, was comprised of three articulated sectors, the SE area, the NW area, and the area to the N of the NW area.
The SE area was laid out around an incomplete peristyle with seven columns along the NW and SW sides (Plan view, Fig. 1). Three semicircular pools projected into a large courtyard. A first pool was located at the extremity of the NW portico (II) facing the main reception room V, and there was a third of which only traces survive. The large court (I) of irregular shape (ca 24x10m) was not paved and may have been planted.

Genava
Location Description Sublocation The Roman town, located at the western end of Lake Geneva at the confluence of the Rhone and Arve rivers, grew from a late first century B.C. settlement of the Gallic tribe of the Allobroges. The town flourished until the third century A.D., and the territory around Geneva attracted many villa owners. There are few remains of Late Roman Geneva, but it appears to have been fortified around A.D. 300 by a circuit wall.
Garden Suburban Villa
Keywords  villae suburbanae peristyle courtyard courtyard  Garden Description This villa suburbana in the modern Parc de la Grange lay outside the town on the southern shore of Lake Geneva. The villa, built originally in the mid 1st c. A.D., was extended in the 2nd and 3rd c., and was inhabited until the 4th c. (Fig. 8.2). It measured 40 x 30.50 m., and it had a separate bath complex on the northwest. The entire estate was 450 m. long and approximately 180 m. in width.
A peristyle courtyard surrounded by covered walkways on four sides took up an area of 22 x 11.80 m., about half of the building. In the center of the courtyard was a pool, very fragmentarily preserved, around which, in all probability, were plantings (G on plan).
To the northwest of the house were enclosed areas which have been interpreted as gardens (G on plan). In the corner of the most easterly of these was an L-shaped pergola. The property between the house and the shore of the lake at the north was terraced and possibly designed as a landscaped park or left as a &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo; park.

Keywords  peristyle terrace  Garden Description This badly preserved building situated on the Plateau des Tranchées was on a terraced slope overlooking Lake Geneva (Lacus Lemanus). Originally built between 20 and 40 A.D., and occupied until 180, the house had a central peristyle courtyard measuring 7.80 x 22 m. in size. Below the peristyle was a terrace where excavations uncovered a deposit 15 cm. thick of organically enriched soil. This evidence suggested to the excavators that the terrace was planted as a garden. Due to subsidence and shifting of masonry walls, the house was rebuilt between 50 and 70 without a peristyle courtyard or a garden terrace.

Keywords  peristyle opus stigninumboth porticoes stylobate plynth pilasters  Garden Description The two known wings of the house were organized around a peristyle (8x 12 m), probably in a U, though the west wall has not been found but has been drawn on the accompanying plan by extension of wall further south. Two of the three galleries were open. The open area of the peristyle court was ornamented by a rectangular pool (5.4 x 2.6 m) covered with opus signinumboth inside and outside; it had a drain in the northeast corner. The surface of the water in the pool would have been above the level of pounded earth floor of the courtyard. Porticoes 2.8 meters wide around three sides of the courtyard also had pounded earth floors; the stylobate was blocks of limestone while the columns were of circular brick covered with plaster painted red in the lower part, white in the upper, and touched with green highlights. The porticoes were terminated at the west end by engaged columns. The painted plaster is preserved in place in the southwest corner of the peristyle. A red plinth sets off tuffs of green foliage; above are black panels bordered with decorative strings. At a later phase, a wall was built between the last two columns of the of the portico; in the space thus created were found bases for shelves. Near the peristyle were found little theatrical masks in terra cotta which had served as oscilla. An ostrich egg, an exotic import, was perhaps also hung in the peristyle. Onto the south portico opened a reception room [B 20] (8.6 x 6.2 m) rhythmically divided by four pilasters and two columns. Onto the east portico opened an even larger room [B 12] (10.5 x 6.5 m). Both reception rooms had concrete floors with limestone accents. There were also two small courtyards &amp;ndash;one in the south wing, one in the east &amp;ndash;both indicated on the plan.

Keywords  villae rusticae mosaic porticoes courtyard  Garden Description This villa rustica was built on the slope of a hill about 30 kilometers north of Colonia Augusta Treverorum, close to the Roman road from Trier to Cologne, now B 51/E29. It is a kilometer or two south of the village of Fliessem. The original core of the villa is of second century date, but the building was enlarged considerably in the third century to take up an area of 4225 square meters (Fig. 1). It was occupied until around AD 400. The house (A on plan) occupied a position at the eastern end of the property, and in its final state it measured 60 x 60 meters and had 66 rooms, many of them decorated with mosaic floors. On the northern and southern sides were porticoes, and from the southern portico with its pavilions a view of the valley below was afforded.
The entrance to the house on the west was flanked by two protruding pavilions framing an open courtyard. Immediately to the west of this was another open courtyard enclosed by a wall. It might be expected, even if the evidence is sparse, that a garden or park was laid out at least in front of the entrance at the west (G on plan).

Keywords  peristyle corridors bath building  Garden Description The villa of this rural estate of the third century and its grounds are the only parts of the complex which have been investigated (Fig. 1). The farm lay about 40 km. south of Trier on a gentle slope above the Moselle river. The villa is of the winged corridor type with a facade of over 45 meters in length, taking up an area of 4200 square meters. In the villa were two peristyle courtyards, but both were paved with slabs of red sandstone rather than having been laid out as gardens.
Parks were laid out on the grounds of the villa. A peristyle corridor 250 meters in length and 8.80 meters in width led from the villa to the bath building on the southwest, although it was not directly connected to either building. From the open-sided corridor one could enjoy the view of the almost certainly landscaped grounds, and of the terrain sloping down to the river. It is assumed that there was another peristyle corridor on the northeast. A grotto on the grounds of the villa belonged to the park.

Keywords  palace portico herms  Garden Description This palatial villa, which has been interpreted as an imperial summer palace, lay within the confines of an imperial domain about 12 km. northwest of Colonia Augusta Treverorum. It was built during the reign of the emperor Valentinian I (364-375) or Gratian (367-383) who resided in the capital. Very little remains of the actual villa, although foundation walls of other buildings and a possible portico have been found.
The grounds of the villa were almost certainly landscaped in some form, as is suggested by a large decorative pool that may have been a decorative focus in a garden. It measured 18 x 60 meters and had three symmetrically arranged apses on the long sides. (Fig. 1) The walls of the pool were constructed of cut stone blocks and the bottom was paved with stone slabs. On top of the edges of the pool was an open-worked stone balustrade pierced at regular intervals by 112 limestone herms. The herms represent gods, Greeks, Romans, philosophers, generals and idealized figures such as putti, as well as Phrygians, Nubians and Germans. These were thrown into the pool in the 5th century, landing perhaps on layers of sediment at the bottom. As a result, the herms, of which 71 were retrieved in excavations, are in excellent condition. At the northern end of the pool was a rectangular building through which ran a drain from the pool. (Fig. 2, View of Model)

Garden Villa des Tuillières
Keywords  courtyard porticos/porticus hypocausts  Garden Description The villa des Tuillières near Selongey was on a Roman road connecting Lyon and Trier. The villa was detected by aerial photography in 1973 and almost completely excavated by the private Association Archéologique de Fontaine-Française in advance of the construction of the motorway A 26/31 Langres – Dijon between 1976 and 1988.
At Selongey, the first Roman evidence was a timber-framed building with clay walls. It can be dated to Claudian or Neronian times. The construction type of this &amp;lsquo;proto-villa&amp;rsquo; continued well-known Late Celtic traditions. Some small, typical Roman stone buildings were erected during Flavian times. In the second century AD, under Hadrian or Antoninus, these first structures were razed to the ground and the complex was re-organized by the construction of a small main building and a huge isolated building for agricultural purposes. The huge stone-built villa complex, with its strict axial arrangement of all buildings around a central courtyard of 1.5 hectares, was constructed at the beginning of the third century AD under the reign of Severus.
During the first half of the 3rd century AD the complex of the villa comprised several buildings, which were arranged around a central courtyard (Fig. 1). The north-western wing of the villa complex was formed by the main building (Fig. 1, B) and the thermae in its classical form (Fig. 1, C) while buildings for agriculture (Fig. 1, A and D) and Iron working activities (Fig. 1, E) were arranged at the other sides of the courtyard. The main part of the villa opened with a long porticus south-east to the courtyard (Fig. 1, B No. 5). At both ends of the porticus small pavilions formed the angles of the main building (Fig. 1 B no. 1). The entrance was situated in the center of the porticus; it gave access to a central hall (Fig. 2, VIII) and to the representative rooms such as the main building which were heated by a hypocaust. The rooms for domestic activities such as the kitchen and service rooms were located to the back.
Two cellars under the rooms X and XIII were used for storage purposes. The cellar under room X yielded the most important archaeological objects of the villa, about 2600 fragments of burnt ivory objects. They made it possible to reconstruct a wooden casket with several application made from ivory. Cellar X obviously contained the treasury of the villa; cellar XIII, food for human alimentation.
The villa was destroyed during the barbarian invasion into Gaul in 256-8 AD, which followed the main Roman roads. The most recent coin found in the villa was an antoninianus of Valerius, coined in Rome AD 254. Because the rescue excavation focused mainly on the building structures, and the open space of the inner courtyard was not completely excavated, the direct garden evidence is faint. Herb gardens and fruit tree gardens can be assumed near the back of the main building. The presence of gardens is indicated by the rich archaeobotanical evidence. The destruction of the villa by fire preserved plant remains. Archaeobotanical analysis of the plant material revealed huge amounts of carbonized cereals and grape pips from building D. The assemblage is dominated by naked wheat (Triticum aestivum s.l./durum/turgidum), hulled barley (Hordeum vulgare) and pips of cultivated grape (Vitis vinifera vinifera). The botanical assemblages from building D contained thousands of grape pips, but also fragmented Vitis stalks and carbonized underdeveloped complete grapes. A possible explanation is that the agricultural building D of the villa complex was not only used to dry and store cereal grain, but also contained a wine pressing area (Fig. 1 D indicated in grey, Fig. 2, rooms II-XII). Archaeobotanical evidence from the villa &amp;lsquo;des Tuillières&amp;rsquo; at Selongey, Côte d&amp;rsquo;Or, and from the villa &amp;lsquo;Tête de Fer&amp;rsquo; near Avallon also point clearly to local viticulture during the third century AD.
Furthermore, there is evidence of lentil (Lens culinaris) and broad bean (Vicia faba), which were most probably cultivated either in the gardens of the villa or on small fields in the vicinity. Carbonized scales from walnuts and uncarbonized fruit stones from peach (Prunus persica) and damson (Prunus insititia) indicate cultivation of fruit trees in the gardens while hazel (Corylus avellana) and sloe (Prunus spinosa) were most probably fruits collected from the wild.

In several areas along this ancient coastline remains have been brought to light of large and sumptuous villas built on the coast, in large coves or high places, with beautiful panoramas.The remains of a villa, called by fifteenth-century visitors to the site “Grotte di Catullo”, after Verona’s poet Catullus, are situated at the northern tip of the Sirmione peninsula, on the southern bank of the Benacus(Lake Garda), the largest of the pre-alpine lakes (Fig.1). As one of the most interesting examples of Roman residential architecture in northern Italy, this villa deserves the designation of villa maritima, as other similar examples along the Campanium-Latium coast.The villa covers an area of around 20,000 square meters distributed on three terraces, which ascend the slope of the hill on a series of substructures. The building has a rectangular plan (167.5 x 105 meters), with two foreparts; on the S side at the main entrance and on the N side at the tip of the peninsula, towards which the villa faced, so as to be surrounded by the lake on three sides (Fig. 2).On the evidence of recent studies, the villa is dated to the Augustan-Tiberian period (end of the first century B.C. –start of the first century A.D.): it was constructed after the destruction of an earlier building, the existence of which has been documented in a small archaeological excavation beneath the floor of one of the rooms on the southern side of the villa. Modifications to the building, in particular the creation of the large baths area, date to the end of the first –second century A.D. The destruction of the villa came quickly, with all probability around the 3rd century: at that time the functioning of the villa seems to have stopped and no later maintenance or building interventions have been identified; a differing situation as regards the other villas in the lake Garda area, which had a continued life, with phases of great importance, up to the first half of the fifth century.The building, constructed as a whole and with axial and symmetrical criteria, is characterized by long terraces on the eastern, western and northern sides: these connect directly with the large terrace on the northern forepart, which was shaded by a veiled covering, as demonstrated by the characteristic elements which supported the posts found in this area. By the side of the terraces were long porticoes: the western one built over a double-nave cryptoporticus, which acted as a substructure, the eastern for the main part built directly on the natural bedrock. The residential rooms were distributed in the northern and southern areas, the western part of the latter being occupied by the baths complex (Fig. 3-4).While the substructures are well-preserved, the residential floor, situated on the higher level, has been subject to greater destruction over the course of the centuries, due to the systematic robbing of building materials, already started in ancient times, the collapse of part of the wall on the eastern side along the hill-side, and in the agricultural use of the land, presently occupied by a vast olive grove (Fig. 5). The villa has been excavated on several occasions from the start of the 19th century and subsequently backfilled, so that the plan and hypotheses for the reconstruction for a large part of the residential level, which has not been the object of new research in recent years, are based on the notes and drawings of the 19th century, not always reliable. Other excavations were conducted between 1941 and 1965; research aimed at defining the chronology of the building and resolving problems in the plan of several rooms in the southern area were undertaken between 1984 and 1994.The events endured by the structure render difficult and at times impossible, at present, to hypothesize the functions and characteristics of many of the residential rooms, as also with the various open spaces present within the building. Undoubtedly, other than the large peristyle (C), which occupied the central area of the building, other open spaces, now buried (courtyards or gardens), were to be found along the central N-S axis. In the southern part there was an open space (N), situated between the western part of the villa, destined as the baths complex, and the eastern part containing the living rooms. In this case, according to the interpretation of the director of the first excavations and more recently, the area functioned as a courtyard giving access and light to the rooms on its E, S and W sides. A wall divided the courtyard from the S side of the peristyle, to which direct access was possible by one or more entrances. Another hypothesis suggests that access between the two courtyards was not axial but by a side corridor, while a wall with windows would have permitted a view of the internal garden.Of the other open space (O), situated to the N, there is uncertainty as to its function. One can hypothesize, on the basis of the 19th century plans, an open space with porticoes on all four sides: perhaps another small peristyle. An element which would confirm its use as a courtyard or garden is the presence of a stone-built rainwater drain, still present in the 19th century and illustrated by Orti Manara in his publication on Sirmione. Some parts of this drain have been re-used in the walls of the Early Medieval church of San Salvatore in Sirmione. There are no precise indications for external gardens and it is only possible to hypothesize the natural setting in which the villa was situated. However it must be stated that artificial terraces had been made on the eastern side of the building, or more precisely the areas which corresponded to the N-E and S-E corners, formed by the two foreparts of the villa. In the first (H) the bedrock has been cut to a depth of around 4 meters to create a large terrace, which occupied the whole area as far as the drop in level towards the lake (Fig.6). It is interesting that the second artificial terrace (I), of more limited extension, at around 10 meters below the residential level of the villa and reached by a flight of steps, was still known in the 19th century, by ancient tradition and without apparent justification, as “the garden.”The large central open space (C), beginning from the 19th century, was identified as a courtyard-viridarium. It is formed by an area of around 4000 square meters, equivalent to about one fifth of the whole area of the villa (Fig.7). Both the 19th century excavations and more recent trenches have failed to locate the presence of structures or floors, and it is therefore possible to hypothesize that the area functioned as a garden, probably surrounded on all four sides by porticoes as indicated in the 19th century plans and supported by recent research.The present land use, with many trees, and the thin soil cover in respect to the original ground surface, no longer permit the acquisition of data to allow a more precise reconstruction of the ancient garden, its internal sub-divisions, the types of vegetation, the possible ornamentation. On the S side of the peristyle is located a large perfectly preserved underground cistern (66), of a length corresponding to the width of the peristyle (42.60 x 2.40 meters). It is covered by a herringbone floor in small bricks, 6 meters wide and around 50 meters long (fig.8). Rainwater, collected in this part of the building, flowed into the cistern through a series of lead fistulae which entered the S-E and S-W corners, as is demonstrated by holes in the floor created by the robbing of the lead pipes, of which fortunately a small part is still preserved in the S-W corner, where it enters the cistern. The floor of the cistern has a slope of 7-8% from S to N: on the northern side four channels collected rain water and allowed it to flow in an organized manner towards the garden, with a slope of 6% (fig.9). The channel was formed in the initial part by a prolongation of the herringbone brick floor, which with its tapering form towards the external area helped the entry of rainwater into the channel, which flowed beneath the ancient ground surface (Fig. 10). The channels, lined with hydraulic mortar, were excavated in the bedrock, which outcropped on the eastern side and were covered with thin stone slabs. On the opposite side they were constructed in the earth and only their lower parts are preserved, the covering and the ancient floor shaving been robbed. Given the slope of the channels, their conformation and number, it is to be excluded that they had the sole function of draining the rainwater from the brick floor, and it may be hypothesized that they also served the function of directing to the garden the water which was extracted from the cistern, perhaps for irrigation.Water was drawn from the cistern by one or more wells: in the 19th century a well-curb, which was said to have come from the area of cistern, was still preserved in Sirmione. By the side of the cut which housed one of the well-curbs, two square holes had been cut into the floor in ancient times. It is hypothesized that they held the posts for the structure supporting the ropes and vessel used to extract water from the cistern (girgillus).There are no other elements to help describe the form of the large peristyle. Two pieces which may have formed part of the decoration of the garden are composed of sculptural fragments: a head dating to the second century A.D., found in the soil inside the cistern (66), and a sundial, presently lost, but fortunately represented by a drawing. Given the location, the head must have come from the peristyle, and can be hypothesized as belonging to the statue of a Dioscuros (fig. 11). In Greek marble, it is broken at the level of the chin. The head is covered by a pilos, from which issue locks of hair, curling on the forehead and sides of the face.There are no useful clues to help reconstruct the vegetation, which may have been present in and around the villa.The climate of Lake Garda is sub-Mediterranean, determined by the notably large mass of water which tends to maintain a constant temperature, much milder than the rest of the cisalpine area. The cultivation of olives already existed in Roman times, as documented by botanical evidence from recent excavations at Sirmione and the strong spread of the plant both in the locality and the whole area around Lake Garda in the Early Medieval period. In the same manner grapes were probably also cultivated, indirectly represented by an inscription found near Sirmione (fig. 12). Probably also common in the Roman period were the native species, shrubs such as oleander and rosemary and trees such as cypress, bay, ash and several species of oak, documented in the last two examples by botanic remains found at Sirmione, recently analyzed by the Archaeobiological Laboratory of the Civic Museums of Como.

Keywords  tombs epitaphs stelae grove (sacred grove) vegetable gardens  Garden Description A marble slab reported at Altinum in the sixteenth century and now in Venice records, above a depiction of an axe, a plumb-line, and a tree with birds, the epitaph of L. Ogius Patroclus, who some time (probably) in the late first or second century, “following the tradition of dutiful respect maintained by the corporation of firemen, donated while still living the gardens with building adjoining the tomb, so that from their revenue roses and food would be supplied generously for his patron and, eventually, for himself” (secutus pietatem col(legii) cent(onariorum) hortos cum aedificio huic sepult(urae) {a} iunctos vivos donavit, ut ex reditu eor(um) largius rosae et esce patrono suo et quandoque sibi ponerentur). The pairing of roses for the dead and food for the living (rosae et escae) was common in Roman funerary celebrations at the grave site, which perhaps suggests that mixed planting of flowers and vegetables was common in Roman tomb gardens as well (cf. ILS 6711, 8371).

Keywords  drains bathhouses (water recreation structures) vestibules basins (vessels) water baths reception rooms courtyards gutters (building drainage components) atriums basins (vessels)  Garden Description The coastal villa was located at the east end of the Gulf of La Spezia and controlled a large fundus. Little is known of the first nucleus of the villa, dated to 120-100 B.C. The layout that has survived dates to the second phase (80-50 B.C.). The excavated portion of the pars urbana is to the north of a large courtyard (Fig. 1: 11). On the same axis with the vestibulum and Corinthian atrium (respectively 1 and 2 in fig. 1) was a quadrangular hortus (Fig. 1:8). Most probably this garden was surrounded by porticoes. Several water canals passed through the garden and ended in Courtyard 11. In the late first century A.D. the main residential part was moved to a higher elevation, and the area of the Corinthian atrium was transformed into a bath suite. These changes affected also the hortus: the level of the area was raised, some service-rooms were built, and in the west corner was the praefurnium.. From the west corner a masonry staircase led to the granaria (Fig. 1: 9). Courtyard 11 possessed in the middle one or maybe two open air water basins. Several underground water drains crossed it, gathering rainfall waters into a main drain, which ended in the cove. Building phases dated to the third and fourth centuries A.D. did not substantially change this space distribution. The villa was inhabited until the sixth century A.D.

Keywords  mosaics (visual works) cryptoportici gutters (building drainage components) podiums (building divisions) peristyles (columnades) porticoes tesserae villae urbanae reception rooms atrium houses mural paintings (visual works) presence chambers  Garden Description This large maritime villa consisted of two parts, labeled “summer villa” and “winter villa”. The “summer” quarters unfold around a U-shaped peristyle, open on the sea-side, with central garden measuring 31.8 x 26.2 m. (fig. 2: 4). No traces of a pool or fountain were found in the center of the garden. The portico, 2.40 m wide, had a mosaic floor in black tesserae with a white border. Many rooms looked into the peristyle, with the main one probably being a triclinium (Fig. 1). On the two opposite corners of this side of the courtyard were also service rooms: Room 6 was the kitchen, 15 maybe a storeroom (many amphorae were recovered, but the room had a mosaic floor). Of the rooms around the peristyle, Room 31 was the most lavishly decorated. The back wall presented a semicircular niche with a statue-base, the floor had an elaborate polychrome mosaic, and the walls were covered with marble slabs. South of the “summer villa” was a long cryptoportico, flanking a garden, no longer preserved, but known from nineteenth century archival documents. The villa was built in the first century A.D. and, at least in part, was used down to the sixth century A.D.

A similar semicircular portico and garden was in the villa of Anguillara Sabatia, but the radial disposition of the rooms of the ‘Villa della Terma’s’ pars urbana is unusual, revealing a desire to lend each room a view onto the garden. The preservation of this villa is poor because for centuries it was scavenged for building material. Dated material ranges from the first century B.C. (brick stamps) to the early fifth century A.D. (coins). It is possible that these remains were part of the nearby “Villa della Statua.”

It overlooked the sea to the west and had a portico at the south (Fig. 1: B), with rooms opening onto it. The main nucleus of the villa unfolded around a rectangular garden surrounded by porticoes on all four sides (the long sides measure 24.5 m.; the short ones 15.2; Fig. 1: U). A rectangular brick pool with a black mosaic pavement was in the north-east portion of the garden (Fig. 1: a). It pre-dates the portico, since it was partly destroyed by the paving of the north-east portico. A terminus post quem for the construction of the portico was determined by a coin of Nero, found inside the pool.
During nineteenth century excavations, fragments of two superimposed wall paintings were recovered in Room C. The outer layer is not well enough preserved to identify any subject, but the preserved fragments beneath show branches and leaves with colored backgrounds of light blue, red, yellow and white. It is, therefore, possible that this cycle of painting depicted a garden, echoing the view of the real plantings visible through the doorway.
North of the peristyle was the bath quarter (Fig. 1: G, H, I, M, P), but it is not completely clear how the two parts of the villa were connected. In a partially excavated Tuscan type atrium (G) with an impluvium, several fragments of a marble torso were recovered, possible from a copy of the Polykleitan Doryphoros or Diadumenos. On the west side of the villa facing the sea was a porticoed garden (Z) and large semicircular exedra (24 m in diameter). Under the mosaic floor of this exedra are traces of an earlier room (Fig. 1: a) with a mosaic floor. On axis with the center of the exedra and garden was a triclinium (6.2 x 12 m) with a black-and-white mosaic floor. Another exedra (7.5 x 15 m), with a black-and-white mosaic floor, had large windows looking to the sea, and beside it a staircase leading to the water’s edge and to a dock.

Keywords  [ambulatione] triclinia charcoal] pollen  Garden Description Excavated in the later 1980s, (Fig. 76) this property features a garden, described by Ciarallo as “laid out in eight ground strips bordered by furrows.” She interprets this layout as a plant nursery, also taking into account that the root cavities throughout were small, 4-8 c. in diameter, with two larger cavities of 20 and 40 cm. The larger cavities flank the axis that divides the garden in half. (Fig. 77) Gardens excavated recently shed light on the layout, which might, alternatively, be seen to comprise two slightly wider beds and two narrow ones that run alongside ambulationes, providing a modest strolling garden adjacent to the triclinium. Elsewhere, gardens of the time of the eruption freatured a variety of plants along these rows that would have been observed and presumably admired by the stroller, either for their exotic origin or for skill in creating new varieties of unusual shapes of familiar plants. The team made 160 casts in this garden. Pollen and charcoal were also collected and indicate the presence of grape (Vitis), hazelnut (Corylus), Prunus, Oak (Quercus), and beech (Fagus). Beech and Oak are also seen in the pollen samples. Tree roots were interpreted as pine (Pinus) and olive (Olea).

Keywords  masonry triclinia pergolas lecti reservoirs lattices  Garden Description A. To the west of the Great Palaestra there was a large garden (a) which was partially excavated in 1954-1956. A low masonry wall with planting spaces in the top enclosed an elaborate masonry triclinium (l. medius, 4.45 m.; l. imus 4.20; l. summus 3.55 m.) with a table 0.65 x 0.75 m.) on the south, west and north sides. This was shaded by a pergola supported by four massive columns finished with stucco. Two elaborate mosaic fountains faced each other in front of the triclinium. Both fountains were an arched niche set into a rectangular façade surrounded by a pediment with a tiny arched niche in the center of the back which spewed water into the pool below. The bronze jet survived in the north fountain. Fig. 78, 12.8.71 Close to identical mosaics on both fountains features a panel with two fish and two ducks on the lower drum, and garden paintings on the on the east and west sides of the fountains as well as on the ends of the lectus imus and the lectus summus. Each fountain had a water reservoir built on the top with steps for access. The south reservoir was 0.63 x 1.06 m., 0.45 m. deep and the north one was 1.10 x 1.04 m., 0.45 m. deep. The lead supply pipe for the north reservoir was found intact, and Dr. De Caro surmised that these reservoirs were provisional prior to the completion of the aqueduct in this area. The paintings on these two elaborate mosaic fountains were quite faded but the details that could be discerned included a yellow-orange lattice fence at the bottom of each with a fountain painted in the center of each panel surrounded by flowering shrubs, trees and birds (Jashemski, Gardens, vol. 1, fig. 261 on p. 176). The east sides of the mosaic fountains were visible from the entrance from the Great Palaestra. The east side of the south mosaic had a bowl–shaped fountain with a square rim with two pigeons sitting on the rim, the one on the right drinking. A date palm stands behind this fountain with three clusters of ripe fruit. One shrub on the right appears to be an oleander with red blooms and a small brown bird perched in the branches, but the remaining plants are too faint to be identified. The fountain painted on the east side of the north mosaic fountain is footed and crater-shaped with two handles. What appear to be two herons perch on the fence facing the fountain on either side, a blue one on the left and a white one on the right. The shrubs in back have the foliage of oleanders with two small birds flying about. From the triclinium the paintings on the west side of the mosaic fountains could be enjoyed. The west side of the north mosaic fountain had another crater-shaped, two handled fountain with a low base and a black bird sitting on the fence to the right. There are traces of a date palm behind the fountain and the rest of the foliage is badly faded but there appears to be some oleanders included in the painting. The west side of the south mosaic fountain had an image of an egg-shaped, footed fountain with a golden color and some detailing to suggest that it may represent a bronze fountain. To the top of the left there remains the crown of a palm tree with a small sparrow-like bird, and although most of the plaster on the right side has fallen there is enough evidence to surmise another palm tree could have been painted here along with some oleanders. Jashemski examined this garden in 1971 and found a series of cavities along the north wall and close to a complete planting pot (13 cm. high, 5.0 cm. dia. at the base, one hole in the bottom and three on the sides). The number of root cavities in the interior of the garden indicated that the triclinium was likely set in a vineyard with the usual number of trees but any evidence of the planting plan had been destroyed by the excavation truck traffic. There was a masonry altar opposite the triclinium near the west wall and a masonry pool in the northwest corner of the garden. The north couch of the triclinum had a garden painting on the east side showing a footed, bowl-shaped fountain centered behind a brown lattice fence. Two birds perch on the fountain but the foliage of the surrounding bushes is too damaged to identify. The south couch was decorated with a similar fence and some bushes. The serving table has traces of a peacock and flowering plants while the niches on the inside of the triclinium couches have some very well preserved garlands hanging between them. The low wall that enclosed the triclinium on the north had a section that survived with beautiful grape vines heavy with large ripe fruit clusters. Fig 79, 12.17.71, Fig. 80, 12.25.71

Keywords  peristyles porticoes pilasters puteals lararia opus signinum doliums  Garden Description B. This vineyard section of the property was excavated in 1984 by Dr. De Caro. A small peristyle garden (b) was enclosed on the east and south by a three column portico with a pilaster on the southwest corner. A low wall joined the pilaster and the west column on the south side with a terra-cotta puteal incorporated into it. The north and east sides of the garden had a gutter. The south part of this vineyard had a small house with a garden painting on the west wall. The excavators found the painting to be badly damaged but a section showing a lattice fence 0.68 m. high with leaves and flowers behind remained on the right two-thirds of the building. All of the painting above the fence had been lost. A huge lararium was built against the north portion of the wall which partially covered the image of a Frejus type statuette of Venus 0.87 m. high. An entrance from the east portico¬ led directly to the vineyard which had been in production at the time of the eruption. At the front of the house on the west end a treading floor for the grapes had been built. The floor was raised, enclosed by a low wall 18 cm. high, and paved with opus signinum. The juice would run into a pair of dolium buried in the soil at the east edge of the floor.

Keywords  aedicula lararia strigillation triclinia dolium [lapilli] [sarculum] [dolabella]  Garden Description A large aedicula lararium on the east wall and a large triclinium (l. medius, 4.40 m.; l. imus 4.00; l. summus 3.80 m.; table between couches 1.00 x 1.67m.) were found in the large area attached to this humble house when excavation was started in 1953-1954. Human remains were uncovered with five gold coins, two gold rings, a strigil and seven medical instruments close to the -triclinium. Next to the shrine two terra-cotta votive offerings, a slender female winged figure (0.155 m. high; Pompeii inv. no. 10569) and a small draped figure with considerable red paint surviving on the drapery(figure (0.165 m. high; Pompeii inv. no. 10150) were found as well as a marble statuette of Hercules (ca. 0.57 high without base; Pompeii inv. no. 10138). South of the triclinium a doghouse had been built by mounting half of a dolium (0.70 x 0.50m.) on a masonry base 0.15 m. high. Further finds included a large terra-cotta funnel, but the function of this area could not be determined. Excavation by Jashemski in 1971-1972 revealed what appears to be a large commercial flower garden. Where the lapilli remained until the 1970s, the undamaged soil contours and root and stake cavities were well preserved. Circular watering depressions remained in one bed that held a small plant. Balloon photographs showed complicated bed arrangements and a path coming from the outside area to the middle of the garden where a left turn led to the triclinium and altar in front of the lararium. Fig.63, 17.7.73, Fig. 64, 8.33.73, Fig. 65, 21A.13.73 An extensive system of rain water collection and distribution had been built. Roof run off was collected in a large dolium on each side of the door and in a nearby pool. Additional water could be brought from outside sources and poured through an amphora tip in the east end of the north wall to fill a dolium imbedded in the northeast corner of the garden. The natural slope of the land was from north to south and the irrigation layout took advantage of this fact. When the dolium in the northeast corner overflowed the water ran down a channel along the east wall watering young trees planted in the channel until it fell into a second half dolium buried in the soil. This process would be repeated the length of the east wall and continued along the south wall. There were channels along the north and west walls and dividing all the beds in the interior of the garden. Fig. 66, 23.23.74, Fig. 67, 21.31.73, Fig. 68, 18.10.73 Eleven large tree root cavities were counted with dimensions of 30 cm. or more at ground level. One grew near the southwest corner of the shrine, three along the walls and seven scattered about the garden. Another huge, partially destroyed cavity about 2 m. could have been an olive tree that grew to the west of the cistern. Many other smaller tree root cavities were found, and carbonized cherries (Prunus cerasus L.) that were found here would identify at least some of these. Along the walls with the tree root cavities were terra-cotta pots similar to those found in the House of the Ship Europa. There were well preserved vine root cavities and post cavities for the pergola over the triclinium. Most of the garden cavities that remained were for the stakes that supported the frames for the shade structures for young bedding plants. Parallel to the west wall, 3.30m. away from it, a row of posts formed either a shed or an arbor with roofing support holes in the wall above. Two ancient gardening tools, a sarculum and a dolabella were found in the garden along with bones, teeth, perfume bottle fragments, and fragments of terra-cotta unguent containers. The house to this garden contained a large number of glass perfume bottles. The assessment of pollen and spores found here are shown in Jashemski, Gardens, 1:282-284 and in Tables F-H.

Garden Villa de Larry
Keywords  courtyard porticoes hedge pergola cistern fountain  Garden Description The site is on the Lorraine plateau, which has been densely occupied and cultivated since protohistoric times. The villa was on the divide between the headwaters of the Seille on the west and the Neid on the east and only 2.3 kilometers from the Roman road connecting Metz, Sarrebourg, and Strasbourg. The combination of the pars urbana and the pars rustica occupied more than 7 hectares, and the pars rustica alone had at least twelve buildings. The site of pars urbana now lies under the airport runway, so all vestiges were destroyed in the construction. The pars rustica lies outside the airport property in cultivated fields. It remains buried but intact and has been (2006- 2007) the subject of further investigation by ground-penetrating radar and other techniques not requiring excavation.
In 2003, in connection with the extension of the north runway of the Metz-Nancy-Lorraine airport, the excavation of the pars urbana within the perimeter of the airport made it possible to trace the evolution of this aristocratic villa. The site was occupied since the beginning of the first century, at first by a wooden building. At the end of the first century, the residence was still only a simple villa with a masonry portico and lateral pavilions covering, in all, about 520 square meters. Nearby were the farm buildings.
At its architectural apogee between 190 and 250, the buildings of the pars urbana enclosed about 5000 square meters. The residential habitable areas - the great rooms, the lateral pavilions, the galleries, the triclinia, the balnea major and minor, the bedrooms and service areas were arranged around the central courtyard and garden areas. The buildings covered a total of more than 1.3 hectares. The rest, more than two-thirds of the pars urbana, were courtyards and gardens.
For ease of description, we will assume that the top of the plan (Fig. 1) is the north side, though in fact it is the northwest side. In these terms, the north side of the central courtyard was open for just over half its length onto a 90-meter-long courtyard or garden along the north side of the pars urbana. This court was bordered on the north by a closed gallery which marked the separation from the pars rustica. In the southeast corner of this large court, in an area of 92 square meters (shaded green and marked with a V and a 1 in Fig. 1, there were discovered definite traces of a pleasure garden, namely, planting trenches and pits for a hedge or row of bushes which marked its limits (Fig. 2). The planting trenches were preserved to a depth of 5 to 15 centimeters. The soil in them was a gray sandy silt, while surrounding soil was the geological clay of the area. The row of bushes was placed parallel to the large, heated reception room just to the south. Detail and a possible hypothetical reconstruction of the layout of this garden are shown in Fig. 3. Moreover, traces of five pairs of post holes in the soil were discovered east of the inner façade of the entry porch and in alignment with it. They may be related to a pergola (8.4 x 2 m) (Fig. 1 and detail in Fig. 4).
Two walkways, now much despoiled of their stones, formed a T (indicated by dotted lines in Fig. 1) and connected this entry porch to the two lateral pavilions which framed the forecourt. Likewise, a large court bordered the western part of the west wing and northwest pavilion. It was enclosed by a wall on the south and west defining an area of 3265 square meters. Erosion of the ancient surface of the soil, however, destroyed any other horticultural traces. In all, the three large courtyards, enclosed or bordered by residential buildings covered 7,100 square meters.
In the eastern part of the pars urbana, an intermediary enclosed space (shaded green and marked with a V and a 3 in Fig. 1) between the northeast pavilion and the gallery of the balneum, was occupied by a garden with a surface of 196 square meters, where two trees were planted in the center. A second interior court (shaded green and marked with a V and a 4 in Fig.1), occupied 504 square meters in the southeast corner of the villa between the southern apartments and the balneum. A deep subterranean structure about five or six meters in diameter may have been a cistern or pool. These two interior gardens related to the baths covered 700 square meters. Finally, the bottom of a horticultural pot was discovered under the porch of the south facade of the villa.
Traces of wooden pipes with iron hoops were discovered running underground across the large central courtyard and to the south of the pars urbana to bring water from capped springs to the central pool, to the baths, and almost certainly to fountains that were not found. A corresponding network of drains and sewers was also found. Just east of the entry porch was a canal for draining off the rainwater from the roof of the entry porch.
In the fourth century, the villa was in large part ruined; the pools were filled in, the courtyards in the center and to the north occupied by wooden structures erected from the end of the fourth century to the sixth century.
The Villa de Larry site is an example of the villa of a country estate where the gardens integrated the architecture of the buildings. The art of gardening bore witness to the will of the builders and proprietors to master nature and the plant world, imposing on them harmonious and regular forms with plans inspired by the imperial prototypes of Rome.

In a part of the ancient city inhabited since the first century, the house occupied a surface (33 x 54 m) of 1782 square meters. Two-story wings of the house surround on three sides a courtyard [1] that may have been a garden. The residential wing, to the south, of careful construction, had four principal rooms with floors of smooth concrete. The existence of a second court farther south, on the other façade of the residential wing has been supposed, but its nature is unknown.

Sublocation Description Durocortorum was mentioned by Caesar as the center of the Remi, a Celtic tribe that sided with the Romans against the Belgians. It then became a federated city, nominally independent. Under Augustus, it became the capital of Gallia Belgica. Many vestiges indicate that it was densely settled and unusually extensive. A network of water supply and sewers has been found; an aqueduct brought water from 40 kilometers. The cardo and decumanus are still identifiable today by vestiges of four gates with arches, the northern one still standing; they cardo and decumanus intersect at the present Place Royale. Today, the city is known for its magnificent Gothic cathedral and its fine champagnes.

Keywords  domus atrium  Garden Description A salvage excavation by F. Berthelot in 1987 revealed part of this poorly preserved house covering some 800 square meters in downtown Reims, about 300 meters from the right bank of the Vesle. (Fig 1) It is near an ancient street which is known for a ten meter stretch. The site was occupied in Julio-Claudian times, but the domus seems to date from the end of the first or beginning of the second century. Its total area must have exceeded 1000 square meters. It was divided into two parts. To the northeast were the rooms for daily life organized around a space (14 x 8 m) that would seem to be an atrium; there was a square (3.5 m) structure in the middle, now worn down beyond recognition, and no other indication of the nature of the space. To the southwest, a space free of construction may have been a garden. It was 12 meters wide and at least 20 meters long; its southwest limit is not known exactly. The northwest wall has buttresses on the outside.

  Garden Description The villa des Rouaux runs along the south side of most of the village of Peltre, which is five kilometers southeast of of Metz. The historical and archaeological context is that of the periphery of Divodurum, principal city of the Mediomatrici, where a dense fabric of Roman rural sites has been found. This villa was 600 meters from the Roman road connecting Metz and Strasbourg.
In 2004, an open air excavation on 2.5 hectares permitted the study of the remains of five buildings organized around a vast rectangular courtyard with the long axis in the northwest-southeast direction. In the southwest-northeast direction, the courtyard was some 70 meters wide. The exact extent in the direction of the long axis remains unknown, but comparison with the complete plans of similar sites suggests that it could have been 200 to 300 meters.
The estate began from a wooden structure built at the end of the Gaulic period [1]. (Numbers refer to plan Fig. 1) It was replaced in the course of the Tiberian period by a building of durable materials. This second phase was then extensively remodeled in the Flavian period to give it an affluent, indeed, a monumental aspect by adding a long portico [2] framed by two pavilions [3]. A bath wing [4] and other touches were added later. In parallel with this evolution of the main edifice, annexes [5] were constructed to define a long rectangular court beginning from the façade of the main building. It was not possible to determine the precise chronology of the construction of this court, but it was, in any event, already in place when the living quarters were enlarged in the next phase.
In this next phase, the space of the estate was structured by building several low, separating walls, perhaps dividing the whole into the classic pars urbana and pars rustica.The pars urbana, of which the central element was the main dwelling, included also surrounding spaces, well defined by the low walls. In front, a pleasure courtyard [6] or garden was developed in harmony with the façade. A pool [7] occupied a good part of the area.
Several fragments of statues of white Grecian marble attest the presence of a rich décor with at least two divinities of which one was Harpocrates (Fig. 2 a Hellenized version of the child Horus). On either side of the main dwelling were smaller courtyards with technical functions. The one on the west [8] encloses the bath wing, which seems to have been added after the expansion of the main dwelling. The courtyard on the east [9] housed various hydraulic equipment, including buried conduits and a distribution box, necessary for water supply to the pool and the bath wing. Back (north) of the main house was a large area 140 meters wide [10] and of unknown extension to the north which may have been an orchard or a park.
The pars rustica was organized on either side of a vast court [11], of which the perspective was blocked by the succession of buildings on the west. In effect, the desire for symmetry expressed in the garden with the pool was somewhat thwarted by this alignment of the pre-existing annexes. A gateway [12] in the middle of the low wall which separates this area from the garden with the pool allowed access to this space [11], which was very much off the axis of the main dwelling. In the interior of the courtyard [11], the only structures found were the remains of a hexagonal foundation [13] around a quadrangular trench. This combination has been interpreted as a funeral enclosure, possibly that of owner who gave the villa its luxurious character. On either side of [11], the annexes were about ten meters back from the fencing walls.
These observations suggest that this large court [11] was not used for agricultural purposes but is rather to be interpreted as a park. In the second half of the third century, the estate declined and became a quarry for building materials. Later, some parts of the ruins were reoccupied until the middle of the fifth century, as indicated by hasty repairs made with salvaged pieces or light materials.

Keywords  portico trellises stylobate amphorae pergola apse cistern triclinium  Garden Description Though the site has an area of 12 or 13 hectares, only one hectare has been excavated, the residential and agricultural part. Two groups of buildings frame a large garden on a slightly trapezoidal, walled area. To the north was the residence; to the south, the utility buildings, including a silo; while to the east, within its own walls, was the farmyard also with several buildings.
The pars urbana at the north end opened towards the south on a large space [1] developed as a garden. The southern façade was a portico stretching between rooms extending forward from either end of the main house. Along this façade [2], excavations have shown a band of gravel on a masonry base bordered by posts. Perhaps these posts supported a trellis along this façade. Against the stylobate of the portico, several bases of amphorae were discovered, doubtless as pots for plants that perhaps climbed on the trellis. A fragment of a white marble disk could be, according to Y. Barat, the only remains of an oscillum that once hung in the gallery.
The garden was divided into quadrants by two perpendicular roads, once paved with stone, though the stones were long ago carried off. The east-west road divides the garden into two equal parts; it starts in the west from a square entrance porch outside the wall not shown on the plan, then passes through a simple door pierced in the wall and framed by two vertical wooden braces. The other road [4] crosses the garden on the central axis of the residential part in the north, connecting the entry of its southern gallery to the utility building at the southern end of the garden. Symmetrically placed postholes on either side of these two roads indicate perhaps the presence of a pergola or bower. A stone basin was found at the intersection of these two roads. Along the west enclosing wall, other postholes with wedging material may indicate two other pergolas.
These roads mark off four plots of garden land. Dark brown layers indicate that they once received regular manuring and additions of wood ash, fragments of ceramic, shells of oysters and mussels, and pulverized mortar. The plan of the plots is marked out by an orthogonal network of horticultural pots, installed at intervals of 4 meters in each direction. Of the 217 of these pots found, more than 100 were in place. Aside from several bottoms of amphorae, the pots were of the classic flowerpot type, a truncated cone, and they all had a hole and in the bottom and three in the side, near the bottom. A single example had four of these lateral holes. There were five different types all with a top diameter of 8 to 12 centimeters and 9 to 13 centimeters high.
The distribution of each size pot has been carefully analyzed. Barat reports that two of the types were used in a consistent way. Type C, dated at the end of Antonine or beginning of the Severine period, was used only in the northern half of the garden. Type E, dated from the Claudian period, was found only along the post holes of the presumed pergola and would have been for climbing plants such as roses or ivy. (Only these two types could be dated with relative certainty.) In several cases, Barat felt that a grouping of two or three types of pots might simply indicate planting at different times in the same place.
On its northern side, the villa had another façade gallery [6], perhaps an ambulation, opening onto the fields. It was almost 44 meters long and has Tuscan and Corinthian columns. To the west, it was terminated by an apse; and to the east, by a cistern. Baths [7] were installed in the east wing. Next to the house, south of the baths, were several flagstones covered by a layer of garden soil, perhaps marking a flowerbed [8] over a drainage bed composed of fragments of tiles. To the south, six pits [9], 20 to 40 centimeters in diameter and 20 centimeters deep, not in the pattern of the other pots, were filled with an ochre-colored silt. Finally, north of the baths, protected by the extension of the gallery of the north façade, was found a group of five little negative casts of stumps, still with traces of the roots.
Near the southwest corner of the villa, a stone masonry slab [5] of irregular plan but generally U shaped is considered a possible open-air triclinium. It was later damaged by the erection of a building held up by posts.
Pollen analyses have yielded some results, although the pollens were damaged and oxidized by the dry environment. Samples of garden soil were both from the pots and from outside them. Several of the species identified, such as plantain, argue for a mown lawn. The tree species indicate the presence of conifers – cedars, larches and spruces (cedrus, larix, picea). An oleaceae (determined by D. Marguerie) poses problems of interpretation. Was it a lilac or an olive? In either case, it is an imported species. The lilac would come from the northeast of the Balkans; the olive, from the Mediterranean. Though the lilac might seem more probable on the basis of current plantings, it is noteworthy that Pliny reports that the olive was acclimated in central Gaul (H.N. V 1-2, XVII, 47-48). The genus Prunus appeared several times, thus confirming the results of charcoal analysis (anthracology) but without determination of the species – wild cherry or domestic cherry. Ivy is also present, perhaps to cover the pergolas.

Solicoffre, then from 1840 to 1848 by P. J. Féret, and again in 1876 by Abbé Loth. The ruins were then abandoned, and our knowledge of them comes entirely from the very uneven documentation of these early explorations. From our perspective, however, what is noteworthy about this literature is not its inadequacy by modern standards but the considerable interest it shows in plants and gardens.
The residential part shows a certain degree of luxury with painted plaster, marble plates, stuccos, and numerous heated rooms. The pars urbana was quadrilateral and was unearthed on more than 60 by 45 meters. In the center was a court [A] of about 25 meters square that was perhaps developed as a garden. In 1843, it was noted that this court was “not yet excavated.” It is not clear whether or not it ever was. Around it were arranged a series of rooms. One large room [HH] (12 x 5 m) with a semicircular apse opened off the southeast corner of the court and must have been a reception room. The central space of the court was apparently bordered on the north, west, and south sides by porticos of unequal width. The bases of the columns and two shafts were found. To the east was found a large area (22.5 x 4.5 m) entirely covered in mosaic. To the north of the villa was a rectangular space [O] that could have been a courtyard or garden. It was bounded on the north by a gallery nearly 25 meters long and heated by hypocausts for its entire length. Semicircular apses extended from the east end and from the north side. Further constructions not excavated extended to the northeast.
Eighty meters to the west, below the villa and parallel to its west side was a belvedere-promenade. This structure (3.1 x 47.6 m) extended in a north-south direction with apses at each end. On the east side was a large room (11.49 x 5.92 m) terminated by an apse on the east and opening onto the promenade and the view to the west. The levels marked on the map of the site imply that this room was 1.48 meters above the promenade, but such a difference is hard to believe. According to Féret, the promenade was paved with mosaic; according to W. Martin, with brick. The semicircular part of the room was ornamented with a “delicious mosaic” of fruits and grapes. The wall of this apse survived up to a height of 10 to 15 centimeters and preserved the traces of a beautiful mosaic (now lost) “in enamel cubes,” that is, smalti. About 1.4 meters west of the apse, in the centerline of this room, was found a masonry mass (1.71 x 1.86 m) considered by some as the base for a statue and by others as the support for a masonry table. Féret called this room an excedra; W. Martin interpreted it as a summer triclinium enjoying a great view of the sea.
The excavators also note at about 55 meters northeast of the promenade a small, square structure that could have been a little temple or shrine. They mention also two springs, one of which had a square basin and was still in use in 1876 by the inhabitants. The waters of the spring on the plateau were channeled by pipes of elm, some of which were discovered: “the trunk of an elm, 1.80 meters long, with its bark still on and hollowed out in the middle by a drill, carried water to feed the baths.” It was found in place along with several others and was then deposited in the museum of antiquities in Rouen.

Keywords  mosiacs courtyard peristyle  Garden Description This villa of a farm near Echternach was of the winged corridor type with sumptuous interior marble paneling, mosaics and wall paintings (Fig. 1). Originally constructed in the 60s of the first century AD, the villa was enlarged until it covered an area of 8928 square meters in the third century.
The protruding wings of the house on either side of the main entrance on the north framed a large, open courtyard, 29 x 74 meters in size, possibly a garden (G on plan). In the middle of this courtyard was a masonry pool of grand proportions (14.50 x 60 meters). In the middle of this stone-paved pool was a square base which once supported a statue, a sculptural group or perhaps a crater. The pool was retained as a decorative element throughout all the alterations of the estate until the destruction of the farm in the late 4th or early fifth century The southern peristyle courtyard (16.50 x 17 meters) within the house itself was initially designed as part of the bath complex in this wing, and in this courtyard was a swimming pool or natatio. Soon after the building of the house, the pool was filled in and the courtyard transformed into a garden (G on plan).
There was a garden from the very beginning in the western peristyle courtyard, as witnessed by the presence of garden soil (G on plan). This garden was later abandoned in the early second century.

Garden Villa de Châtillon-sur-Seiche
Keywords  barn courtyard trench fanum fountain hypocausts forecourt  Garden Description Six kilometers south of Rennes, this village with medieval churches and pleasant promenades along the banks of the Seiche must once have been the site of castellum from which the name Châtillon derives. The fort was probably on a mound a few hundred meters southwest of the ancient farm and villa described here.
The evolution of this agricultural site can be followed from the period immediately following the Roman conquest up to its destruction at the end of the fourth century. The site lies 0.9 kilometers east of the center of the cloverleaf intersection of N 137 with D 34 in the Guyomerais area on the west side of Noyal-Châtillon-sur-Seiche. Rue des Potiers cuts through the site, with the pars urbana on the north and the smaller pars rustica on the south. The Rue de Condate bounds the area on the east. Known since 1904, the four-hectare site was excavated by Alain Provost between 1984 and 1988 prior to development of a residential subdivision.
From a period immediately following the Roman occupation (from 20 BC to about 40 AD) date a stone enclosure for animals, some agricultural walls, and remnants of a simple barn.
A modest farmhouse (Phase 1) was built about A.D 30. To the south extended a courtyard (65 x 70 m), delimited by a trench, which may have had a garden. Outbuildings included a forge, a workshop, and three small homes with fireplaces.
About AD 80, the farmhouse was razed to make room for the first villa (Phase 2).Built of small stones, this villa consisted of five rooms in a line extending 26.5 meters along the north side of a gallery. A wall replaced the trench delimiting the courtyard. Outbuildings included a barn, a mill, and a chalk oven, in addition to the forge and homes.
Then, somewhere around 180, residential structures were attached to the outside of the wall on the east side of the courtyard (Phase 3). They may have been the residence of the villicus. A little to the south and also outside the courtyard was built a square fanum, a type of temple thought to be of Celtic origin and consisting of a tower in a courtyard surrounded by a gallery.
In the first half of the third century, the complex reached it apogee (Phase 4) with an enclosed courtyard of some 3000 square meters with a fountain in the north-south axis of the main reception room of the north wing.
It was possible to excavate only the eastern half and (on the south side of Rue des Potiers) the whole of the wall which closed the south side of the courtyard. At its southwest corner, this wall turned north at exactly the point required to fit a conceptual restoration of the west side as symmetric to the east with the fountain on the axis of symmetry. Along three sides of the courtyard (excluding the south) ran galleries with wooden supports on the courtyard side and a line of rooms on the outside. On the east side, one room was heated by hypocausts and one was a wine cellar. Since an access road was found on the east, the entrance to the courtyard was presumably on the east side of the forecourt on the south, in an area destroyed in the construction of Rue des Potiers.
The villa showed a certain level of refinement in decor. The fountain, lined with marble with decorative moulding, was formed by two masonry squares, one within the other. A central pedestal probably supported a water jet and possibly a statue. A few fragments of marble statuary were found, including the abdomen and buttocks of what may have been a cupid; but precise original locations could not be determined. Though there is no evidence of mosaics, wall painting with imitations of marble and porphyry was employed, as were some high-quality building materials such as slate and schist. Numerous fragments of bronze plumbing were found, along with collars for attaching metal pipes to wooden tubes and sections of pipe to carry away the waste water.
At the end of the third century, the pars urbana was abandonned, then partially re-occupied around 320 – 330 in the age of Constantine. Final total abandonment came at the end of the fourth century.
Was there a garden? Within the courtyard, there is no direct evidence of planting, but neither is there evidence of a hard surface that would preclude a garden, except that between the north gallery and the fountain there seems to have been a passage way. Outside the courtyard, northeast of the supposed house of the villicus, there were parallel trenches interpreted by the excavator as a garden zone (F on the Phase 4 plan).
A study of pollens and sediments below the levels of the Gallo-Roman villa in a paleosol dated to the late first century BC or early first century AD has revealed the environment of the farm at that time. It shows a soil already worked and gardened by man and the presence of pollens of cereals. The countryside, already totally or partially cleared combined various trees – pine, hazel, oak, holly and linden – with ferns and herbaceous plants, especially grasses and plantains characteristic of prairies and grasslands. A comparison with the quantities of pollens found in the soils of the villa in the second and third centuries shows relative stability of the percentages, as shown in figure 5. While interesting, these findings describe the environment rather than the gardens themselves.

Garden House with Pilasters (Clos du Verbe Incarné)
Keywords  domus porticoes courtyard drain  Garden Description Xenia were gifts of game, fish, poultry, fruits or vegetables given by a host to a guest to be cooked to the guest’s liking. Here, the name comes from the discovery of a pinax (a painted ceramic tablet) showing xenia. This house was discovered during excavation of the southern sector of the Saint-Pierre land management zone (ZAC) in a suburban quarter of Lyon. The building –one hesitates whether to call it a suburban villa or a domus–extends over 630 square meters. There are traces of occupation of the site in Augustan times, but the house (29 x 24 m) was built in the reign of Tiberius. It is organized in two perpendicular wings around a courtyard with porticos in a U. The galleries are 3.5 meters wide. In this first phase, nine rooms were placed around the court.
The limit of the court on the west is not certain [phase II, 1]. As a hypothesis, an original court of 17.74 meters by 16.40 meters –nearly square but with an extra, sixth, span on the west –has been proposed. The columns, with a maximum diameter of 37 centimeters, were made of semi-circular bricks cemented and covered with white plaster. They rested on limestone bases roughly squared off. A little later, around the end of the reign of Claudius, the house underwent several changes. Room [10] was built, which enlarged the eastern wing. A new room [3] was created, important enough in the eyes of the proprietor to sacrifice part of one of the porticos to fit it in. In the same period, the spaces between the columns were partly closed, while the courtyard was connected to a water supply network. The paintings were freshened up, and the house doubtless had a second floor. In this last phase, however, the house did not last long. It was destroyed at the beginning of the reign of Vespasian, and the site then remained vacant at least until the middle of the fourth century and probably into the fifth. In this final, Claudian phase, the courtyard represented more than 57 percent of the area. It enjoyed running water, which was not present in the houses of the Verbe incarnéquarter in Lugdunumat the same period. A wooden pipe, of which only the negative imprint can be seen, crossed the courtyard and porticos obliquely. A drain from room [5] was connected to it. The basin of a fountain that has disappeared was placed on the axis of room [9]; it was definitely there in the second phase and possibly in the first, though that has not been demonstrated.
The ground of the central part of the courtyard was topsoil and earth coming from under the porticos. Three samples have been studied palynolocially. The results leave no doubt that a garden grew in the center. We quote the abstract of the publication. “The pollen content is relatively poor, and the counts have been made for each sample separately. The spectrum of pollens includes a rather wide diversity of herbaceous plants of which certain families can include ornamental plants such as the tubuliflorous composites and the Caryophyllaceae (pink family). Ruderal plants, that is, those that grow in sites much transformed by man such as clearings or waste places near habitations, predominate: Chenopodiaceae (such as spinach, beets and their relatives –Tr.), gramineous plants, and the following genera: nettles, arnois (artemesia, tarragon –Tr.), and plantain (Plantago lanceolata). This last is often associated with the cultivation of cereals. There were also species of ferns. Walnuts (Juglans) and grapes (Vitis) may have been cultivated around the site. Finally, pine (Pinus) is relatively well represented, but the very high rate of pollenization of the pine and its capacity for dispersion of its pollens often lead to an over-representation of these species. Thus, this courtyard could have been cultivated as an ornamental garden.” (E. Delaval et al., p. 89).

Sublocation Via Appia
Sublocation Description An early Roman road (via publica) originating at Rome and terminating at Brundisium, the Via Appia was begun in the fourth century B.C. by the censor Appius Claudius Caecus. The Latin author Statius described the Via Appia as &amp;ldquo;queen of the long roads&amp;rdquo;.
Garden Funerary Chamber of Manlia Felicitas
Keywords  villa tombs funerary buildings  Garden Description In 1937 a French student, Louis Vignon, searching for new catacombs around the third mile of the Via Appia near the tomb of Caecilia Metella, discovered a subterranean funerary chamber accessible via a descending stair that ended at a landing which opened perpendicularly into the middle of one of its walls. Each of the other three walls contained an arcosolium decorated with frescoes depicting animal and vegetal life against a background of herbs and flowers beneath hanging garlands punctuated by aquatic fowl, doves, and the heads of youths; beneath the frescoes the lower walls were paneled in polychrome marble. The figured scenes—at the back, opposite the entrance, a pair of peacocks flanking a niche; to the left a pair of Cupids draping a gazelle in a long ribbon; to the right a pair of gazelles on either side of a twisted tree—belong to a stock of Hellenistic motifs evocative of the gardens of the blessed popular at Rome during the Julio-Claudian period and, especially, the reign of Augustus, to which Wuillemier thought the monument belonged. When Vignon returned to the site thirteen years later, the underground chamber could not be located, but at the edge of the site, near an ancient aedicula fronting the Via Appia, he found a marble funerary inscription in a pile of broken stones evidently recovered from a second subterranean room beneath the aedicula. Underground galleries extending off the subterranean room and from the intersection at the entrance to the tomb chamber seemed to Vignon to join the two structures to each other in a large subterranean complex (Fig. XXX). The inscription (AE 1952, 35)—an epitaph to a freedwoman Manlia Felicitas set up by her fellow freedman and husband of thirty-five years, P. Manlius Epigonus, her daughter Manlia Flora, and her daughter’s husband L. Calpurnius Servatus—declares that the “twenty-fourth part” (pars semunciaria) (either of the entire estate or of an acre, about 40 meters square) “in these gardens of the Manlii” (in his hortis Manlianis) entrusted by Manlia Salvilla (evidently the patroness of Epigonus and Felicitas) to Epigonus for him to hand over to Felicitas, Felicitas had wanted to belong to their daughter Flora. It is uncertain whether “these Manlian gardens” refer to a tomb garden proper or to a suburban estate (horti): both are well attested in conjunction with suburban tombs (see vol. 1, 208). Reference to a “twenty-fourth part”, the (indirect) involvement of the patroness Salvilla, and the early imperial fashion of styling suburban estates as “gardens” named after their owners (regularly expressed in adjectival form) here favor the latter. Whether the inscription, which in form and formula appears not later than the second century, can be put into any direct relation with the subterranean chamber with arcosoli, a tomb type more characteristic of the fourth century, remains doubtful. But the discovery of both on the same property perhaps suggests a continuous use of the site as a funerary space for two centuries.

Garden Monumental Tomb Garden Complex
Keywords  courtyards ditches epitaphs funerary buildings sepulchral monuments tombs  Garden Description Two conjoining fragments of a cut marble slab found in the cemetery of Centocelle at the third mile of the Via Labicana, now in the Palazzo Ducale in Urbino, show part of a plan (not drawn to scale) of a large rectangular funerary garden (546 x 524.5 Roman feet, almost exactly 10 iugera, about 5.8 acres, in area) bounded on at least two sides by a private road that branched off near the end of a longer side to intersect a public thoroughfare 1,783 Roman feet (about 1/3rd of a Roman mile) long, beside which several rectangular tomb plots, some marked with border cippi at the (rear?) corners, are marked off in a reed bed. To judge from the stippling on the stone (incompletely marked on the most frequently reproduced drawing of the plan), a second reed bed occupying a triangular plot between the shorter length of private road and a ditch on the opposite side (a subsecivum) extended perpendicularly from the short side of the triangle at the hypotenuse in a narrow band equal in width to that of the reed bed beside the public road and the private road around the perimeter of the enclosure (see the photograph in Luni, fig. 6). De Rossi believed, on no firm evidence, that the property bounded by the public road and reed bed extending off the top of the plan was productive agricultural land attached to the tomb; if so, the territory was perhaps circumscribed by a band of reedbeds and private roads of uniform width bordering the property. But since we know neither the purpose nor the original extent of the plan, the significance of the undifferentiated area outside the enclosed tomb garden remains a matter of speculation: the only features labeled on the plan are the public road, the ditch, and the stippled reedbeds.
The enclosed tomb garden, accessible only by an entranceway at the upper left corner (according to the orientation of the plan) and by a narrow door next to an aedicular structure outside the enclosure in the lower left of the plan, is characterized by a strict formality of design. The garden proper consists of eight rectangular plots marked with stippling, possibly flower beds or lawns, regularly disposed amid perfectly aligned single or triple rows of equidistant circular dots, probably representing trees. A double row of dots separated from the others along the upper perimeter perhaps represents a pergola or elevated walkway. The lower third of the enclosure is dominated by a large tower-tomb monument (perhaps 15 meters square at the base) apparently similar in form to a mausoleum near S. Maria Capua Vetere sketched by Pirro Ligorio and known as “La Conocchia” (“The Distaff”). The tower-tomb sits in the center of a rectangular courtyard bordered by a single row of trees (interrupted by the rear wall of the tomb) that form an ambulatory around the perimeter. The longest side of the courtyard, along the bottom of the plan, gave access to connecting service rooms aligned perpendicularly behind the shorter sides of the courtyard and, in the lower left, a rectangular aedicular building outside the entrance, possibly a funerary shrine or perhaps the custodian’s quarters.
The plan has been dated as early as the Augustan age (by Huelsen, who favored De Rossi’s fanciful attribution of the tomb complex to “Turia”, fragments of whose well known epitaph were found, similarly cut for reuse in covering loculi, in the same cemetery of Centocelle [cf. CIL 6.37053 with 1527, 31670]), but the scale of the complex and the design of the monument seem more compatible with a date later in the first or second century.
The Centocelle plan provides uniquely valuable, if ambiguous, evidence for the arrangement of the planting and the disposition of the monument within a Roman tomb garden (our other surviving plan of a tomb-garden complex [see Claudia Peloris] focuses on the internal articulation of the buildings), but it can hardly be considered typical: not only is the central monument of a form and type not found elsewhere in the region of Rome (the only known parallel is at Capua), but the size of the plot dwarfs all others known in central Italy and is second in area only to the thirty-five iugera (almost twenty acres) of farm land dedicated by a Roman knight at Parma to supporting his funerary celebrations (see C. Praeconius P.f. Ventilius Magnus). If the round dots do indeed represent trees and the stippled areas flower beds, the size of the area laid out primarily, it seems, for amenity (even if the trees bore fruit and the flowers produced garlands and perfume) is far larger than that of other attested funerary gardens in Italy that served primarily a decorative purpose. Productive funerary gardens of comparable and smaller area that we can identify elsewhere in Rome and Italy were normally equipped with work buildings (aedificia) and retail outlets (bars and shops, tabernae) (see vol. 2, XXX). The spaces on the plan flanking the courtyard and identified as storerooms could well have housed farming and gardening tools, but the footprint of the structure in the lower left corner seems ill-suited to the design of a tavern. More probably a collective monument (perhaps of a funerary collegium) than a familial tomb, the complex raises more questions than it resolves about the characteristic form and function of the Roman tomb garden (see no. XXX, funerary collegium of the Cocceii).
Dates The plan was dated as early as the Augustan age, the scale and design seem more later in the frist or second century.

Garden Temple Tomb Garden of Q. Haterius Tychicus
Keywords  funerary buildings sepulchral monuments tombs villa garden pavilions  Garden Description One of the well-known reliefs from the tomb monument of the Haterii found in 1848 at a villa site after the fourth mile of the Via Labicana and depicting the temple tomb they adorned seems to represent schematically a garden and ornamental pavilion (diaeta) enclosed by a perimeter wall or fence in front of the tomb (Fig. XXX). The property evidently belonged to a building contractor, probably the redemptor Q. Haterius Tychicus (CIL 6.607, perhaps a freedman of Q. Haterius Antoninus, the consul of 53 CE), who participated in several prominent public building projects during the Flavian era and who erected his monument (to judge from the style of the relief decoration) during the Trajanic period. The tomb itself, built on an inset tufa base c. 3.5 meters square, partly out of peperino blocks, partly in reticulate work, and partly with brickwork, is almost wholly destroyed. In 1970, about ten meters from the tomb, new excavations at the site unearthed a dedication to Silvanus set up by two Q. Haterii (AE 1982, 78), probably at the boundary of the funerary garden represented in the relief by the enclosed pavilion. In the same garden was found the so-called urn of the Haterii, in all likelihood an elaborately sculpted fountain base.

Garden Tomb Garden of a Funerary Collegium
Keywords  crematories funerary buildings tombs  Garden Description A marble slab found at the cemetery of Centocelle and now preserved in the National Museum in Stockholm records the establishment in 16 CE of a funerary garden and various appurtenances by two senior officials of a funerary collegium and the clearing of an area beyond a perimeter wall for the construction of new crematories (ustrinae). The long commemorative text, our most detailed verbal record of the appointments of a Roman funerary garden, is worth quoting in full:
T. T. Coccei Gaa and Patiens, quaestors (of the funerary collegium) for the third time, according to the will of the decurions set up the square dining table in the pavilion (or, less probably, dining room), the sideboard and base, the sundial, the fountain basin with supports, the marble well, the stucco-work above the wall of the middle path with the tiled roof, the little travertine column beneath the sundial, the projecting eaves in front of the portico, the scales and weights. And, thanks to the kindness and generosity of their patron Titus, they undertook the clearing of a place behind the further perimeter wall and the transferring of the crematories from the furthest fence to there and the construction of a path there and a doorway. And the same men with public money decorated those places which their patron Titus had granted to the decurions with the seeds of vines and fruits and flowers and all sorts of greenery, in the consulship of Sisenna Taurus and L. Scribonius Libo.
T. T. Coccei Gaa et / Patiens quaest(ores) III ((tertio)) / mensam quadratam in trichil(a), / abacum cum basi, horologium, / labrum cum fulmentis, marmor /5 putiale, crustas supra parietem / itineris medi cum tegulis, columel/lam sub horologio Tiburtina(m?) 7 (sic) / protectum ante porticum, truti/nam et pondera d(e) d(ecurionum) s(ententia) posuerunt; / et locum post maceriam ulteriorem /10 emendum ustrinasque de consaepto / ultimo in eum locum traiciendas et / iter ad eum locum ianuamque bene/ficio et liberalitate T. patroni faci/enda curauerunt; /15 idemque uitium pomorumq(ue) et florum / uiridiumque omnium generum / seminibus ea loca quae T. p(atronus) decuri/onibus suis adtribuerat ex pecu/nia publica adornauerunt, /20 Sisenna Tauro L Scribonio Libone co(n)s(ulibus). /
The inscription concludes with eight hexameters urging readers to recognize in the expense incurred the just observance of piety and, for peace of mind, to follow the example of those who created and tended for the garden during their lifetimes so as to be remembered and cared for by others after their deaths (CLE 371). It is tempting to set the tomb complex of the funerary collegium described in this text in relation to the marble plan of a large tomb garden found also found in the Centocello cemetery and now in Urbino (no. XXX), but the references to ustrinae accessed by a path and gate, “the wall of a middle path with a tiled roof”, and projecting eaves in front of a portico are difficult to reconcile with the markings on the marble plan. If the two records do concern the same cemetery complex, the plan does not seem to depict the part of it described in the inscription of the collegium.

The womens’ names are unusual: “R(h)odogune” is recorded only once elsewhere at Rome; “Macariane” (the not uncommon “Macaria” plus a suffix modeled on “Rodogune”?) appears to be otherwise unattested. The absence of a praenomen from Inachus’s name and the abbreviation of his gentilicium point to a date in the first half of the third century.

Garden Tomb Garden of Claudia Semne
Keywords  aediculae funerary buildings pavilions tombs vineyard  Garden Description Four inscriptions unearthed in 1792 between the second and third mile of the Via Appia near S. Sebastiano identify the tomb garden complex of Claudia Semne, wife of M. Ulpius Crotonensis, a freedman of the emperor Trajan (CIL 6.15592-155495; ILS 8063c). According to the principal text (CIL 6.15593), the rectangular tomb monument (c. 3.1 x 3.8 m.) was surrounded by an enclosed garden (hortus) in which were “pavilions (tricliae), a little vineyard (viniola), a well (puteum), and shrines (aediculae) in which statues of Claudia in the likeness of the gods (in formam deorum)” were housed. Within the tomb were two inscribed funerary altars, one dedicated to Fortuna, Spes, Venus, and the memory of Claudia Semne (CIL 6.15594), the other to the couple’s freeborn son (CIL 6.15595), who died at the age of eighteen; and, probably, a statuette of Claudia Semne with the attributes of Spes and three busts of Semne and her son, which were found nearby. The tomb itself was richly decorated by Crotonensis with reliefs and portrait statuary associating wife and son with their divine counterparts, Venus and a young hunter (perhaps Meleager or Adonis). A pair of statuettes of the son wearing a toga and holding a book roll and box probably flanked the entrance to the tomb. In this paradeigmatic context of private deification, the garden was perhaps meant to evoke a Hellenistic funerary paradeisos and its associations with the divine afterlife, but pavilions, wells, and vineyards were standard appurtenances of the Roman funerary garden as well. The style of the sculptural decoration points to a date around 130 CE.

Garden Peristyle Garden
Keywords  architectural paintings villa peristyles (Roman courtyards)  Garden Description Redecorating had been just completed to this site at the time of the eruption and here was found the best preserved garden paintings in Pompeii. Nine stuccoed columns, gold below, fluted white above, supported a portico on the west, north and part of the east sides of this peristyle garden (a) at the rear of the house. A gutter ran along the portico at the edge of the garden. Fig. 9, 50.35.64 Garden paintings decorated the outside walls of the sitting room (diaeta) (b), the small room (c) extending into the garden on the east, and the little room in the southeast corner of the garden. The long rear wall was in full view of the grand triclinium and so the paintings here were the focal point of the garden. Yellow bands separate the wall into three panels and a golden lattice fence on a black background extends across the base. On the left panel a poorly rendered statue of Mars stands on a pedestal in front of the fence. The garden painting behind this is painted on a blue background with an ivy garland framing the top and sides. The left side of the panel shows an oleander with pink blossoms, a myrtle with white blossoms and a heron (Ardea cinerea L.) standing on the fence. Then comes a slender and tall tree-like bush with a large yellow bird, perhaps an oriole, perched within, followed by another oleander in bloom, a pine with a song thrush (Turdus philomelos C.L.Brehm) eating a berry and another bird flying overhead. There is an oleander behind the statue of Mars, to the right a myrtle, a tall slender tree with yellow fruit, more oleanders, and another heron standing in front of an unidentified plant. Three more birds are painted, one hanging upside down like a titmouse to reach some berries (Jashemski, Gardens, vol. 1, figs., 1, 103, 204, on pp. ii, 64 and 129). There is a mask at the center of the top (Jashemski, Gardens, vol. 1, figs. 1, 101 and 204 on pp. ii, 62 and 129). Fig. 10, 18.36.59 Venus is featured on the large central panel floating on a seashell and accompanied by two amorini, one of which is riding a dolphin (Jashemski, Gardens, vol. 1, figs. 101 and 203 on pp. 62 and 128). A narrow brown band runs around the side and top of this panel which dominates the garden. The right side panel is similar to the left one with a blue background, ivy garlands, and a mask in the center at the top (Jashemski, Gardens, vol. 1, fig. 102 on p. 63). The images counted from the left are as follows; a myrtle bush with white flowers and a large bird above it, a clump of ivy in front of this with white flowers, then a tall slender oleander in bloom and another large bird perched on it, next a myrtle with a heron in front standing on the fence, a plant with fern-like foliage and finally a rosebush in bloom. The center of the panel features a basin-shaped, footed fountain on a pedestal in front of the fence. Water is spouting from the center and a bird is perched drinking on the left side rim with a pigeon on the opposing rim. Far into the background behind the fountain is a tree with graceful branches. A myrtle and an oleander with a gray shrike perched on it are painted to the right of the fountain along with another heron walking on the fence, a tall slender apple tree with yellow fruit, and a myrtle with a clump of ivy in front. Inserted into the border of the right panel is a small niche lararium decorated with green plants. Fig.11, 17.19.59, Fig. 12, 50.26.64, Fig. 13, 54.3.64 The outside walls of the small room which extends into the southeast corner of the garden are golden yellow with a red-brown border. The top had an ivy garland, the center caught up with a shield on the south wall and with a helmet on the east. The south wall painting features a two handled, footed egg-shaped fountain standing on a pedestal in front of the fence. It is decorated with three standing figures in high relief, and has a water jet in the center. Directly behind the fountain in back of the fence are a tall slender bush in bloom and a rose bush in flower to the left. There is a bird perching in this bush and a song thrush flying to the right towards a low shrub-like tree with fruit (Jashemski, Gardens, vol. 1, fig. 104 on p. 65). The east wall painting is located to the left of the door with the main feature being a graceful two-handled crater fountain standing on a rectangular pedestal in front of the lattice fence (Jashemski, Gardens, vol. 1, fig. 104 on p. 64). Behind the jetting fountain and the fence is a pine tree (Pinus sp.) with a large wood pigeon (Columba palumbus L.) perched on the top and a large bird flying towards the tree from either side. Low bushes fill the background. A soft green background is used in the garden paintings on the outside walls of the sitting room and the adjacent small room projecting into the garden on the east. The lattice fence is painted along the base and the panel is outlined with bands of red-brown. A bird perches on the right side of a footed, bowl-shaped, square rimmed fountain in the only portion of the south wall painting that remains. Fig. 14, 51.35.64 The fountain stands behind the lattice fence in the center of the panel and to the left just above are some yellow-orange flowers, difficult to identify, with oleanders and some other badly damaged flowers in the background. Daisies are painted to the left of the fountain and part of a tall bush with a little bird survived on the right edge of the panel. A belvedere window that looks out into the garden from the sitting room interrupts two of the panels on the east wall. Both panels have lost the top portion while little remains of the left panel. All that can be discerned here is a footed, bowl-shaped fountain with a bird on the right rim standing behind the fence in a garden of unidentified plants. On the right side panel an elaborate bowl-shaped fountain spouts water behind the fence with two birds perched on the rim, a brown bird on the left and a lighter colored one on the right. The garden behind the fence has a small tree with apple-like fruits on the left and a pomegranate tree directly behind the fountain. To the right is a myrtle in bloom and them one more tall bush (Jashemski, Gardens¸vol. 1, fig. 106 on p. 66). In the foreground are several roses and an ivy mound to the left of the fountain and what could have been another ivy bush to the right. Fig. 15, 22.15.66

At the time of excavation a cistern was noted in the southwest corner, a basin along the south wall just before the jog, and the presence of seven root cavities. Jashemski found a few other scattered root cavities later, but too much damage had occurred from new growth to determine the original planting plan. At the east end of the north wall a door opened to a small sacellum with an aedicula lararium on a small podium on the rear wall and a small masonry. Fig.16, 17.18.59

  Garden Description Located north of the amphitheater, this site was initially identified as the Foro Boario or Cattle Market. A small amount of excavation was started in 1755, but in 1814 the entrance and south wall were excavated. Most of the excavation was completed in the 1950s except the northeastern section. In 1966 Jashemski undertook preliminary sub-soil excavations and proved that the area had been under cultivation. Work continued through 1968 and 1970 removing some undisturbed lapilli and consequently 2,014 vine root cavities were recorded with an equal number of stakes in that section. It was noted that ninety percent of the root cavities had a diameter ranging from 2 to 5.5 cm. with the average being just under 4 cm. The total range of size was from 1 cm. to 8.5 cm. The vines were spaced four Roman feet apart, trained on a rectangular framed trellis (vitus compluviata) and each vine had three or four depressions for watering at the base. Also discovered were two well preserved examples of propagation by layering. A north-south path starting from the entrance divided the vineyard into equal halves. An east-west path crossed this leading to the outdoor triclinium and two rooms where the wine was made. A third path was discovered in 1970 running parallel to the north wall. Fifteen coins were found on the third path, (for identification of these coins see Table E). The paths ran under arbors and usually two root cavities were found by each of the posts that supported the arbor. Rows of trees were planted at the edge of the vineyard between the second and third row of vines, widely spaced trees grew along the paths between the first and second row of vines on each side of the paths, and other trees were scattered randomly in the rest of the vineyard. In all, fifty-eight tree cavities were found, their ground level dimension ranging from 3.5 to 40 cm. Two carbonized olives were found as well as one bean which could indicate that vegetables were also grown under the vines. The entrance directly across from the amphitheater was designed to be an architectural part of the masonry triclinium (l. medius, 4.85 m.; l. imus and l. summus 4.50 m.; table 0.60 x 1.30m.). The entrance pillar matched the extension of the lectus imus across from it in length and width and a low masonry pedestal that was in line with the other entrance pillar shared the same dimensions. The pedestal could have held a lamp or statuette, and the extension of the lectus summus would have been used as a table. A second triclinium (l. medius, 4.60 m.; l. imus and l. summus 4.00 m.) was unique for the pergola posts were supported by a row of amphoras broken off at the top and bottom and buried in the ground along the outside edge of the lectus summus, close to the wall of the wine making building. The entrance triclinium, and perhaps the second one where the wine was made, would have been used to serve those attending games at the amphitheater. Fifty–two bones were found here, (see Jashemski, Gardens, 1:216-218 and Table A on p. 217) with evidence that they were the remains of meals. Serving meals would have been a source of additional revenue for the wine makers. Wine would also have been sold at the shop with the ¬portico that faced the Via dell’Abbondanza that was part of this property.

The inscription, which includes a prayer to Osiris to grant the boy cool water in the afterlife, dwells on the son’s untimely death and his parents bereavement.

It occupies the entire insula and is one of the largest properties in the city. It was originally excavated in 1755-1757, stripped of its works of art and re-buried. In 1951-1952 it was re-excavated and restored but not published. Sixteen elegantly carved slender marble pillars support a portico which borders the peristyle garden (a) on the west.Fig.18, 5.29.59, Fig. 19, 5.32.50, Fig. 20, 5.25.59 An alcove (b) housed a summer triclinium (l. medius, 4.00 m.; l. imus and summus 3.00 m.) with marble faced couches that looked through the portico into the garden. Between the couches a niche supplied water that ran down small marble steps to a hole at the bottom. The water re-surfaced as a jet in the middle of the trilinium. A vine covered arbor stretched along the south and east side of the garden and beyond it in bays on the east wall were raised planting beds, alternating semicircular and square. These were covered with pumice and decorated with a band of Egyptian blue around the sides and top, the middle bay having four bands of Egyptian blue. The room (c) to the south of the triclinium had a garden representation (0.185 x 0.42 m.) on the north part of the west wall on the red middle zone. Four fish ponds connected to form a long channel down the center of the garden. The little marble bridges that crossed the channel and covered alcoves at the bottom of the pools provided shelter for the fish and eels. A number of statuettes were found during the two excavations of this site. More recently the pieces that were found are as follows: A marble satyr (0.475 m. preserved height; Pompeii inv. no. 8856) located at the north end of the pool, a seated terra-cotta figure of Pittacus of Mitylene (0.65 m. high; Pompeii inv. no. 2181-4) found at the edge of the pool, a small marble fountain statuette of a sea crab in a shell (0.19 m. wide; Pompeii inv. no. 1073/54). During the earlier excavation some of the items found were as follows: a satyr child (0.46 m. high; Muz. Naz. inv. no. 6108), a nude youth holding grapes in his right hand and a goose in his left (0.76 m. high; Muz. Naz. inv. no. 6342), a faun(Muz. Naz. inv. no. 6343), an old man covered with a cloth (0.49 m. high), a bird with a lizard in its beak (0.32 m. high), a marble mask of a smiling youth on a small column (0.54 m. high), and a marble relief (0.36m. long x 0.11 m. high) of an old man seated of a bench, perhaps this was a pinax. The heads of twelve marble herms, (one woman, one old man, three bearded men) were reported by PAH, but the post of only one is mentioned and only the feet of the thirteenth herm was found. A terra-cotta group of Caritas Romana was found in many pieces as well as multiple fragments of other terra-cotta statuettes which had been in the eleven niches in the peristyle portico. Chambalu believed the herms stood between these niches.

Sublocation Sperlonga
Sublocation Description Sperlonga is a maritime villa built at the end of the Roman Republic. It probably belonged to some very rich piscinarius, one of those extremely wealthy Roman patricians who took delight in creating their own fish ponds. The purpose might have been to always find fresh fish at their disposal, or, at least, so they said. Actually those Tritones piscinarum, as Cicero called them (CIC. Att. 2.1.6; 2.9.1), considered their piscinae more a status symbol than an industrial operation, and cherished their fishes more as pets than as tasty tidbits (VARR. r. r. 3.17.3). Sperlonga, with its lavish decoration and its luxurious setting, was built by one of these tycoons. Built, yes, but by whom? When, in the middle of the last century, this villa was discovered, some scholars decided that it must have been Tiberius. Actually the only connection we could establish between the ancient emperor and this place is the fact that he nearly died while dining in the villa&amp;rsquo;s colossal nymphaeum. At this time he was traveling from Capri to Rome and stopped at Sperlonga to rest. We read that he was there, on a small island set at the center of the fishpond, laying with his friends on mattresses placed around an elegant water triclinium (Fig. 91, A) set on a small island at the center of the fishpond. They were drinking, chatting and enjoying the splendid view of the statuary groups displayed in the nymphaeum when the entrance of the grotto crashed down in a historical landslide reported by both Suetonius (Tib. 39) and Tacitus (ann. 4.59) (Fig. 92). I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine how this unfortunate dinner could place Tiberius as the owner and the creator of the spectacular grotto. However this is what some scholars assert and they still believe it. I can&amp;rsquo;t agree. For one thing we know that Tiberius disapproved of luxury. In Tacitus (TACITUS) we find the transcription of some of his speeches to the senate and we notice how harshly he attacked all the people who built luxurious villas and bought expensive statues to put in them. How could Tiberius censor his fellows countrymen for purchasing some marble copies of goddesses and heroes, while he himself was importing from Greece those monumental Hellenistic groups, and setting them in the seaside grotto of a more than sumptuous maritime residence? It was not logical, and for this reason we feel quite certain that Tiberius had no part in creating the Sperlongan art display. However, are we sure that the villa didn&amp;rsquo;t belong to the imperial praedia? No, we can&amp;rsquo;t even deny this: Sperlonga could have entered Augustus&amp;rsquo; estate through a legacy. As a matter of fact we know that, on their death, many rich men used to leave their property to the emperor. Some of these tycoons and also some relatives of the Julio-Claudian family could easily have done this. We can&amp;rsquo;t even forget that - as reported by Cicero (CIC. I cent. B.C.) - Philip, Augustus&amp;rsquo; stepfather, was one of the most important and rich piscinarii of the I cent B.C. Apart from this we can&amp;rsquo;t say anything more.
Garden The villa has three gardens: one peristyle garden, one cryptoporticus and the terrace on the sea, one nymphaeum.
Keywords  villa courtyards terrace gardens  Garden Description These parts of the villa have been relatively spared and they are among the best features of this maritime residence (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2002). As a matter of fact, also when the peristyle garden was flourishing, it could never have been as impressive as this imposing cryptoporticus and its underlying terrace (Fig. 93, B), beautiful places to stroll and admire the glorious sunset. The combination of a cryptoporticus and a terrace to create a new kind of garden, was already present in Roman architecture. We can see it depicted in the Pompeian frescoes and we find it in other seaside villas. For instance this kind of open-air arrangement was extensively described in a letter in which Pliny the Younger pointed out the highlights of his cherished Laurentine villa to one of his friend (PLIN. epist. 2.17). In Sperlonga as in Pliny&amp;rsquo;s terrace, a narrow border of flowering plants was set against a low masonry wall, a parapet which was necessary to protect the vegetation from the salty sea breezes (Fig. 94). Today, the fact that bunches of blossoms existed there is confirmed by the presence of a watering system which started from some spring set high on the overhanging hill. We can follow the trace of a groove cut in the rock coming down to the fishpond&amp;rsquo;s northeastern bank. From the piscina side, through a canal (Figs. 91, S; 96), the water was led up to the low parapet of the terrace (Fig. 97), and here, turning at a right angle, it ran all along it. At regular intervals, a series of drain wells helped to draw the water and irrigate the plants. Their presence confirm that a flowerbed existed there and that it was set against the wall.

Garden The villa has three gardens: one peristyle garden, one cryptoporticus and the terrace on the sea, one nymphaeum.
Keywords  villa courtyards peristyles (Roman courtyards)  Garden Description In the villa there are three different garden arrangements (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1990). Unluckily (Fig. 93) all its quarters have been badly damaged by a colony of monks who, probably toward 800 A.D., established themselves and their peasants there. All this people excavated a well in the peristyle, created a tank to wash their linens, moved and demolished many of the portico&amp;rsquo;s columns, and set mangers for the animals in the elegant rooms of the villa. Moreover the family of peasants who tilled the monastery&amp;rsquo;s fields divided this lordly mansion in 8 lodgings. Due to these transformations, today it is nearly impossible to find how the original peristyle looked at its heydays. We can only see the bases of the portico&amp;rsquo;s columns and the remains of what probably was a nice nymphaeum, which, set on the north-eastern part of the courtyard (Fig. 93, N), occupied a large hall, 9 m long and 4.5 m wide, with a semicircular absid at the end. A square basin, 2 x 2 m, stood near the entrance. Apart from this there is nothing else left.

I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine how this unfortunate dinner could place Tiberius as the owner and the creator of the spectacular grotto. However this is what some scholars assert and they still believe it. I can&amp;rsquo;t agree. For one thing we know that Tiberius disapproved of luxury. In Tacitus (TACITUS) we find the transcription of some of his speeches to the senate and we notice how harshly he attacked all the people who built luxurious villas and bought expensive statues to put in them. How could Tiberius censor his fellows countrymen for purchasing some marble copies of goddesses and heroes, while he himself was importing from Greece those monumental Hellenistic groups, and setting them in the seaside grotto of a more than sumptuous maritime residence? It was not logical, and for this reason we feel quite certain that Tiberius had no part in creating the Sperlongan art display. However, are we sure that the villa didn&amp;rsquo;t belong to the imperial praedia? No, we can&amp;rsquo;t even deny this: Sperlonga could have entered Augustus&amp;rsquo; estate through a legacy. As a matter of fact we know that, on their death, many rich men used to leave their property to the emperor. Some of these tycoons and also some relatives of the Julio-Claudian family could easily have done this. We can&amp;rsquo;t even forget that - as reported by Cicero (CIC. I cent. B.C.) - Philip, Augustus&amp;rsquo; stepfather, was one of the most important and rich piscinarii of the I cent B.C. Apart from this we can&amp;rsquo;t say anything more.
Garden The villa has three gardens: one peristyle garden, one cryptoporticus and the terrace on the sea, one nymphaeum.
Keywords  villa courtyards terrace gardens  Garden Description These parts of the villa have been relatively spared and they are among the best features of this maritime residence (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2002). As a matter of fact, also when the peristyle garden was flourishing, it could never have been as impressive as this imposing cryptoporticus and its underlying terrace (Fig. 93, B), beautiful places to stroll and admire the glorious sunset. The combination of a cryptoporticus and a terrace to create a new kind of garden, was already present in Roman architecture. We can see it depicted in the Pompeian frescoes and we find it in other seaside villas. For instance this kind of open-air arrangement was extensively described in a letter in which Pliny the Younger pointed out the highlights of his cherished Laurentine villa to one of his friend (PLIN. epist. 2.17). In Sperlonga as in Pliny&amp;rsquo;s terrace, a narrow border of flowering plants was set against a low masonry wall, a parapet which was necessary to protect the vegetation from the salty sea breezes (Fig. 94). Today, the fact that bunches of blossoms existed there is confirmed by the presence of a watering system which started from some spring set high on the overhanging hill. We can follow the trace of a groove cut in the rock coming down to the fishpond&amp;rsquo;s northeastern bank. From the piscina side, through a canal (Figs. 91, S; 96), the water was led up to the low parapet of the terrace (Fig. 97), and here, turning at a right angle, it ran all along it. At regular intervals, a series of drain wells helped to draw the water and irrigate the plants. Their presence confirm that a flowerbed existed there and that it was set against the wall.

Keywords  tombs epitaphs  Garden Description A handsome marble funerary altar of unknown but presumably urban provenance, now in the Louvre, decorated on the front with Erotes holding garlands and on the sides with storks and other birds records the epitaph of Attia T. f. Quintilla set up by her father, Attius Phlegon, her mother Attia Quinta (probably both ex-slaves), and her brother Attius T. f. Quintianus. Along with the monument, which can be dated to the first or early second century, Quintilla’s parents and brother also dedicated to her and to their descendants and the freedmen and freedwomen of their household “a field or garden (agrum sive hortum) with a building, enclosed by a wall”.The building, a substantial structure of some thirteen rooms, seems to comprise, on the ground floor, a series of three work rooms opening off a central corridor that leads directly through the house from front to back, a two-room suite separately accessible from the front porch (perhaps the residence of the gardner and overseer of the tomb), and a stairway to the upper floor. The upper floor presents a more seigneural aspect: in addition to two large rooms and a pair of small functional rooms corresponding to those on the first floor, the residential space includes a narrow rectangular room or balcony over the entranceway and a two-room suite and a separate room built out above the rear service court and overlooking the garden. A broad passageway eleven feet wide along the side of the building seems to allow for a wagon to be backed into position for loading directly from the garden. The dimensions of the rooms inscribed along most of the interior walls indicate that the three building plans are not drawn to the same scale, and it is not clear how the two structures were situated in relation to each other. The configuration of the aedificium and garden suggests the arrangements of a working kitchen garden with related workspaces on the ground floor and a residential and dining area on the upper floor, perhaps for the use of family members celebrating communal meals at the tomb site during the annual Parentalia and other festivals of the dead. The cepotaphium dedicated by C. Cominius Abascantus at Puteoli in 148 CE provided for the town magistrates and officers of the Augustales to dine annually at the site in a dining room above his tomb (no. XXX).

Keywords  tombs epitaphs  Garden Description A travertine slab of unknown urban provenance, now in the Mus-ei Capitolini, records an epitaph of the mid first century BCE of a freedman doctor, C. Hostius C.l. Pamphilus, who bought a tomb (thirteen by twenty-four feet in area) for himself and his wife Nelpia M. l. Hymnis, and for their freedmen and their descendants. A crude verse (almost a septenarius) following the dedication declares “this is our eternal home, this our farm, these our gardens (horti), this our monument”. It is unclear whether horti here refers to a tomb garden or, perhaps more probably, to a suburban estate, as normally in contemporary fashionable usage. The ambivalence of the term in any case draws a link, conceptual as well as topographical, between productive rural property (fundus) and a burial monument conceived of as a home for the deceased. If horti refers to a tomb garden proper, it would be among the earliest attested in the environs of Rome.

Claudius Eutychus, who left to her sisters and freedwomen and their descendants charge of a building (aedificium) and tomb monument (monumentum). An inscribed plan at the center of the plaque depicting different sections of a building and tomb complex (evidently the ones specified in the text) shows, at the right, a walled tomb enclosure, with the monument built into the rear wall and a corridor leading off the left side of the forecourt to a stair descending perpendicularly to an undergound burial chamber below; at the left, the ground floor of a two storey building (the set of rooms depicted at the top of the plan represents the second floor) with a roughly rectangular walled garden (70 X 76 X 65 X 65 Roman feet, some 410 square meters), opening off the rear (Fig. XXX). The building, a substantial structure of some thirteen rooms, seems to comprise, on the ground floor, a series of three work rooms opening off a central corridor that leads directly through the house from front to back, a two-room suite separately accessible from the front porch (perhaps the residence of the gardner and overseer of the tomb), and a stairway to the upper floor.

Sublocation Via Gabina
Sublocation Description For six and a half weeks each summer from 1976 through 1989 Philip Oliver-Smith and the author (both of Rice University) excavated, often to bedrock, two sites fourteen kilometers east of the center of ancient Rome. The team worked from a surface survey conducted by John Ward Perkins and Anne Kahane in 1964, which traced the path of the via Gabina, a road joining Rome and Gabii and supplanted in the 1st century B.C. by the more up-to-date via Praeneste (today the via Praenestina-Fig.1). This same survey established by the collection of surface material thirty-five occupation sites bordering the via Gabina. From these sites we selected three for further investigation, two of which were fully uncovered to reveal the remains of two suburban villas and a late Roman horreum or giant barn. For recording purposes we kept the site designations of Ward Perkins and Kahane. Therefore the discussion here will refer to the villas at Site 10 and Site 11. In 1976, our first season, two trial trenches located structures at Site 13 (another villa?), but no further digging was done here because of problems involving crop rotation (our work was carried out on the land of a still existing farm), time, and money.
Garden Villa at site 10
Keywords  courtyards corridors domus mosaics (visual works) villae suburbanae  Garden Description This large complex villa structure was founded in the Augustan period and was abandoned in the early 3rd century A.D, with evidence from pottery of continued occupation that time. Not even the peristyle core of the plan could be dated to what we call Period 1 (the early occupation period of the Via Gabina sites). Pottery, roof tile stamps, and construction technique (revetted concrete) all give four phases to the villa remains – Augustan, Julio Claudian, Domitianic, and Hadrianic. Reconstructions have been accomplished for all the phases of Period 2, but what interests us here with our focus on gardens is the last or Hadrianic phase (Phase 2 D – Figs. 4 and 5).
The villa had a western enclosed garden area (Figs. 4 and 5) framed on the east by a Doric loggia at least from the time of Domitian. It was then that the owners created an elaborately decorated triclinium (Fig. 4, “35”) overlooking the garden and affording a view back to Rome (thus setting up the contrast of the serenity of the country with the congestion of the city). This was a major addition to the villa/residence. Phase 2D extended the loggia and gave a greater sense of symmetry to the facade. No pool of any depth was possible because the space of the garden overlaid bedrock-cut chambers for the fermentation of wine. Again, there could be no determination of specific planting; not even flotation material was helpful. It was in this western garden area that a huge horreum/barn was constructed in the late 4th or early 5th century C.E.
2.B.	The peristyle garden of Phase 2D (Figs. 4, “B” and 5) dates from the Augustan core of construction (Phase 2A). Overlooking the peristyle center through a wide double doorway was an oecus or reception/dining room (Fig. 4, “2”) with an emblema (59cm x 59cm) at the center of its mosaic floor. The emblema (now on permanent exhibition in the Palazzo Massimo alle Terme di Museo Nazionale Romano) portrays “The Rape of Hylas” (Fig. 6). This depiction was found in situ and oriented to be seen to best advantage from the couch of the padrone or distinguished guest at the back of the room. The location of the couch was indicated in the design of the black and white mosaic surrounding the emblema – unfortunately the Museo Nazionale’s restoration has reversed this relationship by turning the emblema so it would be read in proper perspective from the door of the oecus and not the couch). From bedrock cuts (Fig. 4, “b”) and a nearby well, it would seem the pool and grotto into which Hylas was abducted was emulated in the open area of the peristyle garden. Hence a view from the principal couch first of the graphic depiction of the rape and then a simulation of the place it occurred. The iconography involved in this sequence and subject relates to the agricultural function of the villa itself and its bucolic character. Because the emblema consists of a single tile containing the tiny tesserae (therefore portable) and can be dated to the beginning of the 1st century B.C., it may well be that the emblema was also an embellishment of the Period 1 villa.
These two sites represent a rare glimpse of the transformation of suburban Rome over more than twelve centuries of occupation.

Sublocation Via Gabina
Sublocation Description For six and a half weeks each summer from 1976 through 1989 Philip Oliver-Smith and the author (both of Rice University) excavated, often to bedrock, two sites fourteen kilometers east of the center of ancient Rome. The team worked from a surface survey conducted by John Ward Perkins and Anne Kahane in 1964, which traced the path of the via Gabina, a road joining Rome and Gabii and supplanted in the 1st century B.C. by the more up-to-date via Praeneste (today the via Praenestina-Fig.1). This same survey established by the collection of surface material thirty-five occupation sites bordering the via Gabina. From these sites we selected three for further investigation, two of which were fully uncovered to reveal the remains of two suburban villas and a late Roman horreum or giant barn. For recording purposes we kept the site designations of Ward Perkins and Kahane. Therefore the discussion here will refer to the villas at Site 10 and Site 11. In 1976, our first season, two trial trenches located structures at Site 13 (another villa?), but no further digging was done here because of problems involving crop rotation (our work was carried out on the land of a still existing farm), time, and money.
Garden Villa at site 11
Keywords  barns atrium houses courtyards villae suburbanae  Garden Description This villa at Site 11 was a simple “U” plan farmhouse initiated at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. (Period 1). In the Augustan Age this farmhouse was transformed into a more luxurious atrium type villa/residence (Period 2 – Figs. 2 and 3). During the reign of Trajan a bath suite was added as well as an outside plunge pool in what seems to have been a western enclosed garden (hortus) from as early as Period 1. Because of the proximity of bedrock and the fact the slight earth cover had been ploughed for centuries, any evidence of what might have been planted in the garden had long since been destroyed. We know, however, that there must have been surrounding olive groves from the press facilities of the villa, also dating from the time of Trajan. All was abandoned in the second or third decade of the 3rd century of the Christian Era.

Garden Villa at Luna
Keywords  drains bathhouses (water recreation structures) vestibules basins (vessels) water baths reception rooms courtyards gutters (building drainage components) atriums basins (vessels)  Garden Description The coastal villa was located at the east end of the Gulf of La Spezia and controlled a large fundus. Little is known of the first nucleus of the villa, dated to 120-100 B.C. The layout that has survived dates to the second phase (80-50 B.C.). The excavated portion of the pars urbana is to the north of a large courtyard (Fig. 1: 11). On the same axis with the vestibulum and Corinthian atrium (respectively 1 and 2 in fig. 1) was a quadrangular hortus (Fig. 1:8). Most probably this garden was surrounded by porticoes. Several water canals passed through the garden and ended in Courtyard 11. In the late first century A.D. the main residential part was moved to a higher elevation, and the area of the Corinthian atrium was transformed into a bath suite. These changes affected also the hortus: the level of the area was raised, some service-rooms were built, and in the west corner was the praefurnium.. From the west corner a masonry staircase led to the granaria (Fig. 1: 9). Courtyard 11 possessed in the middle one or maybe two open air water basins. Several underground water drains crossed it, gathering rainfall waters into a main drain, which ended in the cove. Building phases dated to the third and fourth centuries A.D. did not substantially change this space distribution. The villa was inhabited until the sixth century A.D.

Sublocation Description Durocortorum was mentioned by Caesar as the center of the Remi, a Celtic tribe that sided with the Romans against the Belgians. It then became a federated city, nominally independent. Under Augustus, it became the capital of Gallia Belgica. Many vestiges indicate that it was densely settled and unusually extensive. A network of water supply and sewers has been found; an aqueduct brought water from 40 kilometers. The cardo and decumanus are still identifiable today by vestiges of four gates with arches, the northern one still standing; they cardo and decumanus intersect at the present Place Royale. Today, the city is known for its magnificent Gothic cathedral and its fine champagnes.

The date of construction is rather uncertain; it could be as early as the end of the first century or as late as the second half of the second (Fig. 1) The excavations have revealed a portico (A) (20 x 3 m) opening onto an open space which may have been a garden. It was bordered on the southwest by drain which no doubt collected rainwater from the roof and led it away to the northwest. A well (E) was in the north gallery or corridor (B).

Ternick, this large house has been uncovered in a roughly elliptical area with axes of 40 and 20 meters. The chronology is uncertain. It was perhaps destroyed by a violent fire (of which there are traces elsewhere in the city) in the second century and not reconstructed. Some walls were decoratively painted; most floors were concrete, but there is some evidence of mosaics. The floor of room [5] (just below room [1] in the plan) had a large slab of black marble in the center in frame with smaller slabs in the corners. The southwest corner of a peristyle and 12 meters along the west side and 10 meters along the south side have been excavated. The galleries had concrete floors and slender Tuscan columns 20 centimeters in diameter and 1.2 meters apart. The walls were painted red. In the center of the peristyle court was a masonry construction considered as an “impluvium” at the time of excavation, but it was quite possibly a pool. If it were a pool, then the area was almost surely in a garden. The house had another interior open court and possible garden [17] of about 6 x 7 meters near a well [25].

With the addition of an annex on the east in the early fourth century, the facade of the house acquired a length of 104 meters. The farm was occupied until the early fifth century.
The main residence is a villa of the winged corridor type (BEL 13.1.1). Two protruding wings on either wide of the entrance on the south framed an open courtyard which may have been planted (G on plan). Behind the house at the north were two more wings framing a second open courtyard (G on plan). This area, possibly a garden, was bordered on the north by a low wall.

This house was demolished when the imperial baths were erected in the last decade of the third century. It seems to have occupied an entire insula measuring 55 x 100 meters. (Fig. 1). An atrium (A on plan) was built in the west wing of the building in the first half of the second century. The atrium was later transformed into a garden with planting beds and a pool. Around the middle of the third century this garden was abandoned. The house also boasted a large peristyle courtyard on the east which may have been planted (G on plan), but for a garden there is no direct archaeological evidence.

Garden Villa Borg
Keywords  porticoes basins courtyard  Garden Description The villa of Borg is situated in a forest between the villages Borg and Oberleuken, community of Perl (Landkreis Merzig-Wadern), in the border-region Germany - Luxembourg - France. The huge villa complex is situated in a densely occupied Roman settlement region on the fertile plateaus between the river valleys of Saar and Mosel. Pars urbana and pars rustica covered an area of about 7.5 hectare. The villa was built in the direct vicinity of the Roman road from Metz to Trier (Augusta Treverorum), which was part of the far-distance connection between Marseille and Cologne.
Recent archaeological excavations have shown traces of an earlier rural settlement below the foundations of the villa. This first occupation can be dated to late Celtic times or directly to the beginning of Roman occupation. In the second quarter of the 1st century A.D. it was followed by a possibly two-angled timber-framed building of 17.80 x 10.40 m, which is interpreted as proto-villa. The construction of the later stone-buildings took place around 50 A.D. The main period of the villa lasted from the end of the 1st to the late 3rd century A.D. From the middle of the 4th century A.D. (Plan, Fig 1)onwards only some parts of the villa were still occupied. It was completely abandoned by the end of the 4th century A.D.
Since 1987, the eastern part of the site, the pars urbana, was completely excavated. The main building, a porticus villa, type Bollendorf, was completely reconstructed, exactly on top of the Roman foundations. The pars rustica in the western part, covering an area of 400 x 150 m, is not yet excavated. Geophysical measurements gave evidence of two parallel rows of at least 14 small buildings; possible used for storage and handicraft activities.
Unfortunately only a few architectural elements, like the two water basins (Fig 2), gave hints to the Roman garden architecture. The huge water basin of 10 x 30 m and the two-angled central porticus building of the villa were enclosing a yard, which was most probably laid out as a representative Roman garden in Mediterranean style. A few remaining fragments of stone sculptures point to a representative garden architecture. Additionally, archaeobotanical investigations gave evidence of agricultural activities connected with the villa. A waste pit excavated in the inner yard of the pars urbana revealed carbonised waste of processing spelt and einkorn, probably grown as maslin. Further cultivated crops were emmer, naked wheat, hulled barley and the pulses lentil, pea and Celtic bean. Evidence of fruit tree cultivation is scarce. Only pear and a fragment of an undetermined cultivated Prunoideae fruitstone were recorded.
In the year 2000, the reconstructed main building of the villa with its bath, now occupying a small museum, was completed by the reconstruction of a representative Roman garden. This garden is situated between the reconstructed central building and the huge Roman water basin. In the following it was completed by a vegetable garden, a rose garden and a small vineyard, presenting Roman horticulture to the public. The reconstruction was part of the European Union’s Interreg-II project &amp;ldquo;gardens without borders&amp;rdquo;. Concerning the poor local evidence from the recent excavations the reconstruction was mainly based on the better evidence of Roman gardens from villas in Italy and France.

      <description>Province Mauretania
Mauretania Tingitana (province)(Pleiades)
Province Description An ancient district of Africa in Roman times, Mauretania lay west of Numidia and covered most of present-day Morocco and western Algeria. By the second century BCE, when Jugurtha of Numidia was rebelling against Rome, Jugurtha’s father-in-law Bocchus had most of Mauretania under his control. In 25 BCE Augustus appointed Juba II as ruler of Mauretania. Claudius divided it into two provinces: Mauretania Caesariensis, with Caesarea (modern Cherchel) as capital, and Mauretania Tingitana, with Tingis (modern Tangier) as capital. By the end of the 5th century CE, the province had disappeared.
Location Volubilis Volubilis (Pleiades)
Location Description Volubilis was the capital of the province of Mauretania Tingitania. The city was of Punic foundation, located on the edge of a plain that slopes down from the Zerhoun hills. During the reign of Juba II, king of Mauretania, Volubilis knew a prosperous period. He was succeeded by his son, Ptolemy of Mauretania, who was assassinated in 40 CE by Caligula. The kingdom was then divided into two provinces, and Volubilis was elevated to the rank of municipium as a reward for taking the side of Rome during the conflict.
The city rapidly developed and expanded; new temples, baths, civic buildings and luxurious houses lining the porticoed decumanus maximus were built. The olive press and the mills attached to the houses attest to the rural character of the region. The city reached its climax in the beginning of the third century CE and survives today as a well-preserved archaeological site. The city walls and gates, Caracalla’s triumphal arch, the Capitolium temple, and the Basilica law courts survive. A number of houses known for their floor mosaics and bronze sculpture also persist to the modern day.
Garden House of Flavius Germanus (La maison de Flavius Germanicus)
Keywords  columns (architectural elements) peristyles (Roman courtyards) peristyle house piscinae porticoes  Garden Description The House of Flavius Germanus, dating to the third century, is located between the decumanus maximus, the decumanus north I, the House of the Labors of Hercules, and the House of Dionysus and the four Seasons. The peristyle was enclosed on four sides by a portico supported by 14 columns (Plan view, Fig. 1). The space between the columns was spanned by a low wall. Along the north portico, a rectangular pool, curved at its center, extended into the garden and faced the oecus (label 12) opening into the garden. At the southeast corner was a domestic shrine with an inscription giving the name of the owner. During the second phase of the house, a large garden was added at the rear, bounded by a wall on the southern side.

In 25 BCE Augustus appointed Juba II as ruler of Mauretania. Claudius divided it into two provinces: Mauretania Caesariensis, with Caesarea (modern Cherchel) as capital, and Mauretania Tingitana, with Tingis (modern Tangier) as capital. By the end of the 5th century CE, the province had disappeared.
Location Caesarea
Iol Caesarea (Pleiades)
Location Description A prestigious city on the southwestern shore of the Mediterranean Sea, Caesarea is located approximately 100 km west of Algiers. Situated on the border of an upland plain dominating the sea and bordered on the west and east by the mountains of the Chenoua and of the Cape Ténès, respectively, the city was one of the ports that the Carthaginians established on the coast of the Maghreb.
The city was originally known as Iol. Just after the fall of Carthage during Julius Caesar&amp;rsquo;s reign, the city was controlled by African dynasties and later became the capital of the amalgamated Massyle kingdoms ruled by Micipsa (son of Massinissa) and Bocchus (king of the Maures and ally to Caesar). In 33 BCE after Bocchus’ death, Rome annexed the kingdoms and entrusted them to a client king, Juba II. Juba was the son and successor to Hiempsal II, one of Pompey’s allies. He was sent as a hostage to Rome in 25 BCE and later married Cleopatra Selenus, daughter of Cleopatra and Mark Antony. Highly learned, Juba was renowned for his achievement in transforming Iol into a Greco-Roman town, renamed Caesarea. Juba II was succeeded by his son, Ptolemy of Mauretania, who was murdered by Caligula in 40 CE. The city then became the capital of the province named after it, Mauretania Caesarea, the eastern part of Mauretania (the western part being a second province, Mauretania Tingitana), administered by a provincial governor.
Under Claudius the city became a Roman colony, Colonia Claudia Caesarea. The old Phoenician port was enlarged and expanded for military use, the most important such port in North Africa after Carthage. The city expanded, with 7 km of walls surrounding an area of about 370 acres. From the end of the second and through the fourth centuries, the city was a flourishing settlement. During the middle of the fifth century, Saint Augustine preached in the principal church. At the end of the fifth century, the city was conquered by Vandals, eventually being annexed by the Byzantine Emperor later during the sixth century.
The city has been continually occupied to the present day, now known as Cherchel. From the Roman period, many archaeological sites have survived, including temples, baths, houses adorned with mosaics and sculptures, a theater, a forum, a judiciary basilica, an amphitheater, a large hippodrome, and a lighthouse constructed on the islet of the city.
Garden House of Iustiniani and Sabini (Maison de Kaid Youcef)
Keywords  columns (architectural elements) courtyards domus mosaics (visual works) peristyles (Roman courtyards) villae urbanae  Garden Description The only house for which it is possible to furnish a complete plan is located to the south of the grand temple, from which it was separated by the decumanus. To the east and west side lie two houses, which have yet to be excavated. It is one of the largest domus discovered in Caesarea, covering over 2330 square meters. Surveys prove that the house dates back to the Augustan era.
This domus, containing both baths and small shops, is arranged around a rectangular peristyle garden of 22 by 24 meters. Four porticoes, supported by six columns on the northern and eastern sides and five on the southern and western sides, surround the open area with a low wall that features three semi-circular basins, each of which faces a reception room.
In the southwestern corner, a small room protrudes into the gallery and opens into both the northern gallery and a rear garden on the south. Along the western gallery, a small door opens up to this second garden that surrounded the large reception room. Opening through a tripartite entry into the peristyle garden, this room was decorated with a mosaic that bore the inscription FL(aui) IUSTIANI ET SABINI (I).

A large circular pool filled most of the courtyard. Plants may have been grown in the space between the portico and the pool. The central space of the north portico was framed by two taller, twisted Corinthian columns in between which was a pedestal that supported a fountain sculpture. The elevated north portico permitted a good view into the garden from the triclinium (label T).

The large rectangular garden peristyle, 28 by 15 m, was enclosed on four sides by a portico supported by 17 smooth Corinthian columns. The space between the columns was spanned by a low wall, 0.60 m high. The north part of the garden contains a square shallow pool, with water spouting from semicircular recesses placed along the inner sides of the pool. The overflow drained through a recess carved in the north external side of the pool facing the main reception room (label T). The peristyle is of Rhodian type; the north side of the portico was elevated in order to give more light and air to the reception room. Additionally, the low wall that enclosed the peristyle was interrupted on the north side to allow a better view of the garden from the reception room.

They are next to each other and share a common wall.
In the eastern house, it is impossible to determine if the courtyard contained a peristyle garden. However, it did have three porticoes paved with mosaics, one of which figured wild animal hunting.
The western dwelling was organized around a narrow peristyle garden, 8.5 by 16.5 m, in which the open area was only 1.6 m wide. Jean Lassus describes this unusual peristyle garden as a sort of &amp;ldquo;atrium&amp;rdquo; with its four-sided slanted roof and a garden as the impluvium. To the east was a reception room, decorated with the well-known Harvesting of the Vines mosaic (Mosaïque des Vendanges).

Just after the fall of Carthage during Julius Caesar&amp;rsquo;s reign, the city was controlled by African dynasties and later became the capital of the amalgamated Massyle kingdoms ruled by Micipsa (son of Massinissa) and Bocchus (king of the Maures and ally to Caesar). In 33 BCE after Bocchus’ death, Rome annexed the kingdoms and entrusted them to a client king, Juba II. Juba was the son and successor to Hiempsal II, one of Pompey’s allies. He was sent as a hostage to Rome in 25 BCE and later married Cleopatra Selenus, daughter of Cleopatra and Mark Antony. Highly learned, Juba was renowned for his achievement in transforming Iol into a Greco-Roman town, renamed Caesarea. Juba II was succeeded by his son, Ptolemy of Mauretania, who was murdered by Caligula in 40 CE. The city then became the capital of the province named after it, Mauretania Caesarea, the eastern part of Mauretania (the western part being a second province, Mauretania Tingitana), administered by a provincial governor.
Under Claudius the city became a Roman colony, Colonia Claudia Caesarea. The old Phoenician port was enlarged and expanded for military use, the most important such port in North Africa after Carthage. The city expanded, with 7 km of walls surrounding an area of about 370 acres. From the end of the second and through the fourth centuries, the city was a flourishing settlement. During the middle of the fifth century, Saint Augustine preached in the principal church. At the end of the fifth century, the city was conquered by Vandals, eventually being annexed by the Byzantine Emperor later during the sixth century.
The city has been continually occupied to the present day, now known as Cherchel. From the Roman period, many archaeological sites have survived, including temples, baths, houses adorned with mosaics and sculptures, a theater, a forum, a judiciary basilica, an amphitheater, a large hippodrome, and a lighthouse constructed on the islet of the city.
Garden House of the Scattered Branches and Flowers (Maison de la Jonchée)
Keywords  columns (architectural elements) domus fountains mosaics (visual works) peristyles (Roman courtyards) terrace gardens villae urbanae  Garden Description Located on the southeastern seaboard of Cherchel, this domus was only partially excavated but is still considered to be one of the largest houses of Caesarea. The ruins discovered between 1963 and 1964 are spread out over more than 60 meters from east to west and 30 meters from north to south. The house had two levels separated by a terrace wall, 15 meters of which have been uncovered.
To the north, a rectangular pool was discovered on the lower level. It measured 10 meters by 7.5 and included a fountain built on a square-shaped base, 2.8 meters wide. The sides had rectangular recesses and also included a water spout in the shape of a pyramid. The tracing of the pipe was still visible. The center of the peristyle may have been planted.
Only part of the southern gallery was excavated. The gallery was 3.15 meters wide and the low wall that separated it from the garden was 0.5 meters thick. The gallery roof was supported by columns, whose bases were 3.2 meters apart (Plan view, Fig. 1).
It is assumed that the peristyle and its garden may have had a view over the sea. One of the rooms sharing this view was decorated with the mosaic of the Jonchée famous for its uniqueness.

      <description>Province Mauretania
Mauretania Caesariensis (province)(Pleiades)
Province Description An ancient district of Africa in Roman times, Mauretania lay west of Numidia and covered most of present-day Morocco and western Algeria. By the second century BCE, when Jugurtha of Numidia was rebelling against Rome, Jugurtha’s father-in-law Bocchus had most of Mauretania under his control. In 25 BCE Augustus appointed Juba II as ruler of Mauretania. Claudius divided it into two provinces: Mauretania Caesariensis, with Caesarea (modern Cherchel) as capital, and Mauretania Tingitana, with Tingis (modern Tangier) as capital. By the end of the 5th century CE, the province had disappeared.

Location Description A prestigious city on the southwestern shore of the Mediterranean Sea, Caesarea is located approximately 100 km west of Algiers. Situated on the border of an upland plain dominating the sea and bordered on the west and east by the mountains of the Chenoua and of the Cape Ténès, respectively, the city was one of the ports that the Carthaginians established on the coast of the Maghreb.

Garden House of the Tizerine Cape (Maison du Cap Tizerine)
Keywords  cisterns (plumbing components) columns (architectural elements) domus fountains peristyles (Roman courtyards) porticoes terrace gardens villae urbanae  Garden Description A large domus, about 2400 square meters, located on the cape of Tizerine, with three separate courtyards, one of which was a garden peristyle (Plan view, Fig. 1). The courtyard to the south, the largest, was partially excavated. Only three porticoes with low walls were visible. There was probably a basin in the open area but only a cruciform cistern was found underneath.
The northwestern courtyard was decorated with a large pool, which had a water spout in the shape of a pyramid. Inside the pool were recesses, of which six were semi-circular and the others were square-headed. A planter may have surrounded this elaborate pool.
The northeastern courtyard was most likely a peristyle-garden. There, a basin probably used for watering the little garden was excavated. It dates from second to third century.

By the end of the 5th century CE, the province had disappeared.
Location Volubilis Volubilis (Pleiades)
Location Description Volubilis was the capital of the province of Mauretania Tingitania. The city was of Punic foundation, located on the edge of a plain that slopes down from the Zerhoun hills. During the reign of Juba II, king of Mauretania, Volubilis knew a prosperous period. He was succeeded by his son, Ptolemy of Mauretania, who was assassinated in 40 CE by Caligula. The kingdom was then divided into two provinces, and Volubilis was elevated to the rank of municipium as a reward for taking the side of Rome during the conflict.
The city rapidly developed and expanded; new temples, baths, civic buildings and luxurious houses lining the porticoed decumanus maximus were built. The olive press and the mills attached to the houses attest to the rural character of the region. The city reached its climax in the beginning of the third century CE and survives today as a well-preserved archaeological site. The city walls and gates, Caracalla’s triumphal arch, the Capitolium temple, and the Basilica law courts survive. A number of houses known for their floor mosaics and bronze sculpture also persist to the modern day.
Garden House of Venus (Maison du cortège de Vénus)
Keywords  columns (architectural elements) mosaics (visual works) peristyles (Roman courtyards) peristyle house piscinae porticoes reception rooms  Garden Description The House of Venus, approximately 32 by 37 m and dating to the middle of the third century, is located between the south decumanus I, the south decumanus II, the south cardo V, and the House of the Portico. The square-shaped peristyle, 13 by 14 m, was enclosed on four sides by a portico supported by 8 columns. The space between the columns was spanned by a low wall, 0.65 m high. A long I-shaped pool cut the garden along the northeast/southwest axis of the vestibule and the oecus (label 11; 10 by 8 m). Two pilasters framed the north side of the pool that faced the entry of the house. The galleries of the garden peristyle were paved with mosaics, one of which featured a bird-circus. Five rooms opened toward the garden, some of which were reception rooms.
On the south side of the house, adjacent to the oecus, two rooms (labels 14 and 15) opened into a courtyard (label 12) adorned with a curvilinear U-shaped pool. The space limited by the pool may have been planted, a tree grows there today.

      <description>Province Mauretania
Mauretania Caesariensis (province)(Pleiades)
Province Description An ancient district of Africa in Roman times, Mauretania lay west of Numidia and covered most of present-day Morocco and western Algeria. By the second century BCE, when Jugurtha of Numidia was rebelling against Rome, Jugurtha’s father-in-law Bocchus had most of Mauretania under his control. In 25 BCE Augustus appointed Juba II as ruler of Mauretania. Claudius divided it into two provinces: Mauretania Caesariensis, with Caesarea (modern Cherchel) as capital, and Mauretania Tingitana, with Tingis (modern Tangier) as capital. By the end of the 5th century CE, the province had disappeared.
Location Tipasa
Tipasa (Pleiades)
Location Description The etymology of Tipasa means the “crossing bridge” in Phoenician, suggesting that the place had a function of a waystation on the maritime road between Carthage and the Columns of Hercules. After the kingdom of Mauretania was transformed into a Roman province in 40 CE, Tipasa became a municipium with Latin privileges under Claudius in 46 and a colony under Hadrian or Antoninus Pius. In 146-147 a vast city wall was built under Antoninus Pius, extending the previous enceinte that protected the promontory. The new wall had 31 towers running from the eastern promontory to the western hill. During the IVth century, the physiognomy of the city completely changed with the construction of two new major structures: inside the city, the largest Christian Basilica in Roman Africa and outside its walls, an extensive necropolis that spread along the shore, both to the east (on the Algiers road) and to the west (towards Cherchel). A circular mausoleum has also survived to the west of the city. In the Vth century the Vandals invaded the city and controlled it until the Byzantines took over in the VIth century.
Garden The Villa of the Frescoes (La villa des Fresques)
Keywords  bathhouses (water recreation structures) cisterns (plumbing components) columns (architectural elements) domus peristyles (columnades)  Garden Description This large domus looking out toward the sea had known two phases. In the second phase, completed during the Severan period, the courtyard of the peristyle was transformed into a garden, and both baths and a reception room opening toward the sea front were added.
The peristyle garden had four porticoes supported by 14 columns and enclosed by a low wall, with an entrance on the north end. Two semi-circular planters (see Fig. 1 labels X and W) extended into the garden facing the oecus (label 1) and the vestibule (label 18). Ceramic planters and the remains of pilasters or building stones were also found near the peristyle. At the time of the construction of the baths, a new cistern was built under portico (label V). The beautiful lid that covered the puteal of the garden was removed to serve as a cistern opening for the new reservoir and was replaced by a masonry curb. Towards the sea side, the level of the solarium (label K) looking into the garden was raised to the level of the new reception room (label J), which previously had been a terrace.

House Description In 1984 – 86, prior to construction of a parking garage, a large area of some 4,700 square meters was excavated south of the Cours Pourtoules. About a third of the ancient structures were reinforced and reburied; the rest was destroyed. The area encompassed several ancient houses; the one of interest to us is in the west insula.
Keywords  mosaics (visual works) doliums opus signinum reception rooms fountains opus sectile (visual works)  Garden Description The garden to the south is not completely known. The north gallery (BG), 5.5 meters wide at its widest point, was paved with black-and-white mosaics for at least 35 meters. At the west was a gallery (17 x 3.5 m) with a floor of pounded earth. One side was perhaps with a full wall pierced by windows. In the southwest corner of the garden was a well (FS) for which a half *dolium, found destroyed in the well, served as a puteal. The soil of the garden is brown clay with strata of sand. Analysis of this soil has not been able to identify traces of what was planted in it. The garden was probably put in during Augustan times, but the paucity of ceramic material that could support this date must be underlined.
In phase IIIA, the large room H was divided by columns into a central nave and aisles along the sides, where pilasters along the walls matched the columns. The central nave was paved with a new mosaic while the aisles kept a floor of opus signinum. The gallery [BG] kept the same floor as before. A long rectangular pool [BF] was installed along this gallery without touching it. Somewhat surprisingly, it was not centered either between the galleries of on the reception room [H].
In phase IIIB, in the second quarter of the second century, the east and west galleries of the garden were paralleled on the outside by two new open walks elevated some 40 centimeters above the level of the garden. To the south was added a structure to close in the garden. The well disappeared in this phase. In the area [CB] was installed a shallow pool suggestive of a foot bath. It was fed by a fountain roughly in the area [CI], but too badly damaged for precise description. Two little channels in the rim separating the two pools let the water flow between them. Fragments of a luxurious opus sectile which ornamented this arrangement were collected. Stairs at the northwest corner of the pool [BF] allowed one to get in and out of the pool. The smooth-shaft Corinthian columns of gallery [BG] were moved to be perpendicular to those of [FK]. Their regular spacing was interrupted in front of the large room [H] to leave open the view of the garden.
Among the objects found at Cours Pourtoules was a terracotta oscillum representing a theatrical mask. The site was abandoned at the end of the second or beginning of the third century.

Villa Puissalicon, villa de la Condoumine
Keywords  bathhouses (water recreation structures) [opus spicatum] columns (architectural elements) opus signinum statues fountains reception rooms  Villa Description This villa in the plain of the Libron at the place called la Condoumine in the commune of Puissalicon, was first noted between 1926 and 1942 and excavated beginning in 1965. The total site extends over six hectares; the constructions of the villa must have covered some 2500 square meters but only about a quarter of the structures are known for certain. Especially well known are the baths on the south of the villa, which were complemented by a large ornamental pool.
The chronology of the villa is incompletely known. Built in the last quarter of the first century B.C., it was remodeled several times. The baths were particularly affected at the end of the first century A.D. One senses a new series of transformations in the second century and an apparent impoverishment in the third century followed by a revival in the fourth with a remodeling of the baths at the end of the fourth or beginning of the fifth century. It was abandoned in the course of the fifth and sixth centuries. A walkway [2] separated the buildings to the south from those on the north. Paved in opus spicatum, it has yielded many fragments of its pictorial décor. The precise structure of this walkway, however, is puzzling. It would make good sense for the well-constructed wall A on the south to have supported the columns of a gallery, while the frescoes were on the south side of wall B. But wall B was of very rough construction with only mud mortar between the stones, hardly the proper support for such elegant decoration. Exactly what the structure was and where the frescoes were remains uncertain. In any event, south of wall A was a vast courtyard ornamented by a large pool parallel to the walkway (44 x 3 m, 1.2 m deep) with a horseshoe-shaped apse nine meters in diameter. It may have served also as a reserve of water. The bottom was lined with pavers of opus signinum with masonry quarterround to make edges between the bottom and the sides watertight. A lead pipe mounted in a marble plaque provided drainage. The water came from the baths in a canal lined with marble and poured into the pool though a series of mouths of which one in Carrara marble was found, broken, in the pool. The north wall of the pool extended another forty-five or so meters farther to the west to a little square building three meters on a side. In the opinion of the excavator, a garden extended to the south of the pool, where several fragments of high quality statuary were unearthed. A rare find was discovered in digging out a sewer: a marble fountain head, similar to the base of a column but having inside a circular disc, also of marble, with two holes and a bottom shaped so that the water pressure would cause it to turn in its housing, letting water spurt though when one of the holes was over the inflow pipe and otherwise cutting off the flow, thus giving the water jet an intermittent, bouncing effect. The gallery led to baths [19-26]. In a second phase, they were dismantled and the heating system filled in. Two little rectangular pools belonging to fountains were created, one on either side of the door of the former caldarium [23], and another ornamental fountain was placed against the south exterior wall of the baths, blocking a former door and passage way. The apse of the room was enlarged and assumed a horseshoe shape. One may well ask, with Alain Bouet, whether in this late phase the space did not take on the function of a reception room.

It was arranged in a U around a garden surrounded by a square peristyle 13.5 meters on a side. The principal room was in the center on the north side, looking south across a portico to the garden. The peristyle had eight columns on each side except the north, where the central two were missing to open the view of the garden from the main room. To judge by the foundations, the columns on either side of this opening were larger than the others. A rectangular pool (4.9 x 2.1 m.) on the garden side of this opening had a semicircular apse on its south side. It was probably about seventy or eighty centimeters deep; but the depth is uncertain, for the top has not been preserved. It was lined with opus signinum and had masonry quarterround to make the edges watertight. Around the garden, except at the pool, ran a gutter in dressed stone.

House Suburban Villa de la Brunette
Keywords  atriums atrium houses porticoes gutters (building drainage components) reception rooms colonnades columns (architectural elements) statues  House Description To the west of Orange, this residence is just south of the amphitheater – which was destroyed in the eighteenth century. More than 2000 square meters have been unearthed. It is bounded on the south by a fencing wall 150 meters long and on the north by road that separates the house from the amphitheater. The east and west boundaries are not known. Constructed in the first century A.D. (condition 1), the habitation was greatly remodeled and embellished towards the end of the second century (condition 2) only to be abandoned in the first half of the third century.
Garden Description Condition 1: The central building is organized around an atrium which opens to the east on the garden through a 2.9-meter wide portico [3]. This portico extends all along the east side of the building and forms a transition between the rooms of the house and the garden. On the north, it opens onto the rooms [4] to [7]. Room [7] is the most spacious of the residential part. The garden [30] unfolds to the east of the villa. Its full surface is unknown, since its limits to the north and to the east are unknown. The form of the plantings has not been ascertained. In the garden, 15 meters from the portico [3], was a rectangular pool [31] 13.35 meters long, more than 3.5 meters wide (to the limit of the excavation) and more than a meter deep. It is covered with a layer of tile with waterproofing strips in the corners. Around the pool, the ground was covered with pebbles.
Condition 2: Towards the end of the second century, new constructions radically transformed the suburban villa. It was enlarged to the south, and was henceforth organized around an east-west axis of symmetry, that is to say, determined by the two courtyards with portico’s [23] and [27]. The first room, [23], is square (7 by 7 meters). Situated at the west of the building, it leads into several large rooms; the central part {of what?} doubtless had a stone floor. The large room [27] is between one courtyard [23] and the second courtyard [7], (7.20 by 11.50 meters), separated from the garden [46] by the portico [3]. This courtyard {first or second?} was certainly planted, for the soil is arable earth. It is surrounded by a U-shaped gallery with columns 2.50 meters apart and crowned with Corinthian capitals. A gutter at the foot of the portico collected rainwater. There was no passage towards the center. {What center???} Outside the axial room [25], two other reception rooms opened directly onto the courtyard: the rectangular room [29] and the room with the trilobe plan [31]. A fourth reception room [30], further back, opened into the southwest corner of the gallery.
In comparison to the previous phase, the garden [46] has been considerably enlarged; its southern limit has been pushed back about 40 meters. The portico which ran along the west side [3] has been lengthened up to the wall delimiting the villa on the south. It returns towards the east by a wider gallery [44]. The two galleries meet in a circular room 8 meters in diameter [45] of which only the foundations remain. The elevation could have been a curved wall pierced with bays or a colonnade.
At the heart of the garden, the rectangular pool [47] of the first condition was kept. Along the gallery [3], a semi-circular pool [48] with an internal diameter of six meters was added. It is separated from the gallery by an elongated.

Keywords  porticoes columns (architectural elements) opus signinum triclinia mosaics (visual works) reception rooms peristyles (columnades)  Villa Description Taradeau lies about thirty kilometers west of Fréjus in the valley of the Argens between Les Arcs and Lorgues. The Gallo-Roman villa sits at the foot of the hill of Saint Martin, at an altitude of 70 meters, some 750 meters north of the Argens. It was excavated from 1994 to 1999. This villa with a Roman wine press was occupied from the first century B.C. to seventh century A.D.. In stages 1 and 2, it was a farm, which was then remodeled into a villa (stage 3) in the last years of the first century or first half of the second. The former farm became the agricultural part, while a new pars urbana was created. It was organized around a garden [1], 34 meters on a side, surrounded on three sides by a U-shaped, 2.3 meter-wide portico with columns. In the center of the garden was an ornamental pool (7.2 by 2.8 meters and 1 meter deep) lined with opus signinum with an overflow drain to the exterior of the south enclosing wall. It is presumed that the villa was supplied water by an aquaduct. Around the pool, cuts into the substrate have attested the planting of trees or large bushes which would have embellished the interior of the garden. The northern portico, of the Rhodian type – that is, with higher columns than the other three – opened onto a main room [2] (7.6 by 3.6 meters) which is centered in the axis of the pool. To the west, a triclinium[3] (5 by 3.5 meters) had a floor paved in opus signnum decorated with marble plaques indicating the placement of the three couches.
In a fourth stage, the villa lost its residential character: the pars urbana was converted into a winery. The ornamental pool was modified to feed a hydraulic device [4]. It was extended to 18.4 meters in length and joined to a second rectangular basin (5.2 by 1 meters) which led the water into a final basin which served to turn a horizontal waterwheel.

Keywords  basins (vessels) columns (architectural elements) opus signinum  Villa Description 1.2 kilometers south of the village of Andance, at the place called Château-Pipet, in the little valley of the Cueil, structures belonging without doubt to a Roman villa were discovered. As early as 1867, the abbot Chaillet noted the presence of ruins in this area. A salvage excavation in 1964 partially exposed a long ornamental pool associated with these structures. A rectangular garden [1] of 152 square meters formed a part of the villa. On the east side, the garden was bounded by a an unusual wall formed by eight half silos, or, seen form outside the garden, semicircular niches. Perhaps these niches were hidden by a wall along their back side, outside the garden, for a little of such a wall remains at either end. On the inside of the garden, in the middle of this wall were the beginnings of a larger apse (shown in dotted lines on the plan). One can see in this structure a supporting wall with internal buttresses. To the west and to the south, the space was bordered by a gallery [2] ; the shafts of its columns were discovered in the excavations.
Between the garden and the gallery on the west was a rectangular pool with a semicircular apse extending into the garden in the middle. This pool, about 24 meters long and 2.3 wide, was covered in opus signinum. It was perhaps completed by two arms along the other galleries, thus forming a U. On the south side were found the beginnings of five rooms, but it was not possible to excavate them. In the northwest corner of the garden, a repair was found in the form of a wall running parallel to the pool but 50 centimeters east of the garden-side pool wall. It has been interpreted as a waterproofing device: a fill of a layer of green clay was place there without doubt to stop infiltration of water [4].
No date was proposed for the structure in the excavation reports.

Keywords  peristyles (columnades) opus signinum reception rooms porticoes mosaics (visual works) bathhouses (water recreation structures)  Villa Description In the locality of Muscapeu, at the foot of a slope, was found this villa. Partial excavations in 1950 to 1960 exposed 4200 square meters. Constructed in the first half of the first century B.C. , it was occupied until sometime in the third century. An aqueduct from a spring supplied water. The pars urbana is to the east; the pars rustica to the west.
In state 1, from a sort of podium, the pars urbana, 34.5 meters on a side, overlooked the surrounding fields. At the center was a peristyle [1] (16.6 by 3.2 meters); and in the center, a rectangular pool (16.6 by 3.2 meters) with a bottom of opus signinum. The drain came out of the southeast corner of the pool and flowed along the south façade.
The living quarters were between the colonnade of the peristyle [2] and that of the façade of the villa [3], which opened out onto the surrounding countryside. In this northern wing, in the axis of the pool, was a reception room [4] completely open to the portico of the peristyle. The other rooms of this wing are poorly known but they had floors with white mosaics with black borders and stone thresholds with sockets at the ends for the pins on which the doors pivoted. In the southwest corner, a room with an apse, a floor of opus signinum, one part elevated and a square masonry base in the center has posed problems of interpretation: is a lararium, a place for religious services, or part of the baths to the west?
In a second stage, in the first century, a bath complex [5] with an open-air esplanade was built to the southwest of the peristyle. In a third stage, these baths were redecorated with marble. In a final stage, in the second century, new baths [6] were constructed to the west of the original complex, but the original was not abandoned.

Keywords  peristyles (columnades) porticoes columns (architectural elements) reception rooms  Villa Description This wine-producing villa, constructed under the Flavians, lies in the plain, in immediate proximity to the sea. Excavated in 1985 and 1986 and covering an area of some 2000 square meters, it went through three stages between the last quarter of the first century and the beginning of the third century. The site was then re-occupied in the fourth century.
The principal buildings were constructed in the first century; in the second century, the peristyle [1] was added. The garden in it (8.3 by 6.6 meters) is surrounded on four sides by a 2.3 meter wide portico, with five columns on a side. In the garden were found trenches for planting trees and vegetables. To the south, a gallery serving as a façade runs along this peristyle. To the north, there was a square reception room [2] (4.5 meters on a side) later embellished by the construction of a large bay on its garden side. The bay was framed by two columns more massive than the others of the portico that supported a pediment and lifted the roof of this portico above those of the rest of the peristyle. To the west, a structure in the corner formed no doubt a tower and belvedere overlooking the sea. To the east of the peristyle, a second courtyard, [5] had a well whose rim was the top of a dolium. Further to the east was a bath wing (50 by 30 meters). North of the reception room was an open-air courtyard [4] 8.3 meters wide, and beyond it, the storage area for wine in casks occupied a large area 52 meters long and 12 wide.
In a final stage, at the beginning of the third century, the garden was transformed into a court and then into a dump, and the south branch of the peristyle was divided by a partition.

Sublocation Description Halfway between Avignon and Cavaillon, this villa is west of the present village of Caumont-sur-Durance where the road forks with one branch going to Bonpas and the other to Avignon. It sat upon a little mound overlooking the Durance. Known since its fortuitous discovery in the middle of the nineteenth century, the site is the source of the famous, acephalous Venus of Caumont, a beautiful marble statue now in the Calvet museum.Villa Villa de Muscapeu
Keywords  peristyles (columnades) mosaics (visual works) porticoes hypocausts orchards  Villa Description The site of the villa is practically completely covered by modern houses. The villa, of vast proportions, was built on successive terraces whose form survives in the present layout of lots. The part already excavated have revealed a sigma-shaped portico and at least two groups of rooms connected with baths. The construction was luxurious as attested by fragments of opus sectile, mosaics and wall paintings of quality, and especially by beautifully made architectural tiles called Campana plaques, with low-relief volutes and images of porticos, winged victories sacrificing bulls .
In the course of test probes for the construction of a subdivision, a large ornamental pool was found on the terrace below the villa. In 2001, a program of archeological research was begun on this vast terrain which was once a huge garden, 140.6 by 83.5 meters for a total surface of 1.2 hectares. To create a level surface, the lower parts to the south and east had been filled with earth moved from the upper parts. A wall around the outside 60 centimeters thick completely enclosed the terrace; sections fallen in place show that it was 2.9 meters high. It is still standing on south and east sides, where it continues to function as a retaining wall. On the west side, below the villa, it both served as a buttress and gave an esthetically pleasing, monumental façade to the terrace. In this part of the wall, semicircular niches, 3.32 meters in diameter extended out, away from the garden at regular, 18.75 meter intervals; open on the garden side, they may have served to accent sculptures. These niches alternated with semicircular buttresses, also protruding outside the garden but walled up on the line of the wall. The were constructed on top of the embankment and were thus anchored at a higher level..
The inside of the wall was covered by carefully executed opus reticulatum, a technique common in Italy but rare in Gaul. This fact has given rise to the hypothesis that the proprietor brought workmen from Italy. On the basis of the construction and the general context, a dating in Augustan times, in the last third of the first century B.C. has been proposed. Despite the internal buttresses, the wall was not sufficiently well founded against the embankment on the west side, and soon fell over.
Doubtless also from the Augustan period is the monumental, elongated rectangular pool (66.05 by 4.58 meters), 1.2 meters deep, which cuts across almost the entire width of the garden approximately in its center. It seems impossible to date its creation later than the year 1. The inside was covered with a thick layer of smooth opus signinum painted red. A rim of limestone flagstones terminated its border. The ground was covered with a careful opus spicatum extending over some 202 square meters with a blend of bricks of colors differing according to differences in firing. A flight of five limestone steps in one corner allowed easy descent into the pool.
The water supply system for the pool is not known. A nearby spring may have contributed to filling this 280 cubic meter pool, without, however having a sufficient output to fill the pool completely. One can also imagine pumping from an inlet cut in the bank of the nearby river, and the contribution of captured rain water is not to be forgotten. At the eastern end, a horizontal plughole permitted emptying the pool into a sewer. Outside the pool, running underground along its north side was a drain designed to lower the ground water level, keep the subsoil healthy, and avoid uplift under the pool when it was emptied. It is possible that, besides its ornamental function, the pool served for raising fish, though no chambers for egg laying were built into its walls and no submerged container for hatching was found, and carpological samples have given no positive results.
The first stage, described so far, was followed by a second in which an important restauration took place. The west wall, which had shown signs of weakness, was rebuilt along nearly 40 meters, this time with regular blocks of limestone bound together with lime. Rectangular pillars, encroaching on the garden, marked off rhythmical intervals of the wall. At the same time, fill added to the north west corner raised its level nearly a meter. Excavation of this fill yielded numerous fragments of furniture and of construction material, including nearly 50 fragments of Campana plaques. These fragments permit the dating of this whole operation to the beginning of the second century.
A third stage corresponds to the late use of the garden. In the southwest was installed the shop of a tile maker. North of the west end of the pool, near one of the niches, stuck against two buttresses of the wall were built small baths. They had a warm room with the pool in a little apse and a tepid room on little piles. Heating was provided by an exterior fireplace in a court. Since the pool was still filled with water, to connect to two halves of the area without a long detour around an end, a bridge was built over the pool. It rested on monolithic piles made from re-used columns. Some fifty coins and a purse lost at the bottom of the pool date this transformation to the second quarter of the fourth century.
The abandonment of the garden marked its fourth and final stage. Gradually, the pool filled in and the baths crumbled. At the end of the fourth or beginning of the fifth century, several burials were made in the area, notably in hypocaust under the collapsed baths, in tombs covered with tiles placed to form a little gabled roof or in African amphora.
In an effort to determine whether the garden was ornamental or productive, Philippe Boissinot, undertook a study of traces of planting in a area that was sealed in antiquity by the collapse of the enclosing wall. A series of pits could be clearly excavated (Fig. 1&amp;amp;2) Rectangular holes in lines corresponding to grape cultivation were associated with bigger pits, without doubt those of the trees that supported the vines. This method of viticulture, widespread in antiquity but rarely identified in the south of France, may well be suggested. The second zone investigated, against the southeast wall, was without doubt an orchard.

Keywords  aqueducts opus signinum colonnades stairs porticoes mosaics (visual works) reception rooms peristyles (columnades) triclinia  Villa Description On a cliff overlooking the sea stood a elegant maritime villa in what is now the quarter of the Baumelles. Excavations go back to the eighteenth century, but new researches were carried out between 1969 and 1973. The first building, dating from the times of Augustus or Tiberius was replaced during the last quarter of the first century by a grand residential villa which existed until the end of the fourth century, though there are traces, such as coins, of very late occupancy even into the fifth century. The luxurious pars urbana covered 1.4 hectares, while the pars agrarian spread out to the south. The villa was supplied with drinkable water by an aqueduct.
The villa descends, level by level, over several terraces that go down to the southwest towards the sea. The top terrace, in the northeast, opens to the southwest onto an interior garden [1] 32 meters wide with a rectangular pool (2.4 by 14.5 meters) coated with opus signinum. To the northeast, a colonnade (4.8 meters deep and 43 meters long) formed the façade in front of a residential wing, probably accessed by stairs. From the portico behind the colonnade, paved with a white mosaic and with walls covered in marble, opened three reception rooms [ 3, 4 and 5]. The garden was bordered by a buttressed wall which marks its limit. Along the southwest side ran a gallery in which a collector caught the rain water and drained it towards the pool [7] which could overflow into a channel leading to the sea. This sector was not all built at the same time.
To the southwest, a second residential complex, closer to the sea, was developed around a vast garden [8] surrounded by a peristyle with brick columns. The mosaics of the rooms of the northeast wing have been destroyed while the rooms of the southeast wing still have their marble plates and their mosaics in place. This wing is enriched by a series of beautiful reception rooms [9 to 12], of which [12], opening onto the portico, is considered a triclinium. The western and southern limits of the peristyle are poorly known.
An 80-meter gallery running the full length of the villa served as the southwest façade beside the sea. Its stone columns rested on cubical bases. To the south rose a tower, doubtless a belvedere [16], which was perhaps balanced by a symmetric one at the other end of the gallery.
To the south, a charming apartment overlooked the cove of the Madrague and may have been winter living quarters. Below, on the lowest level, another court [14] reached by stairs [13], was embellished by a large rectangular pool (9.92 by 6.15 meters) with an apse at either end. The pool was lined with opus signinum with quarter-round molding for waterproofing in the corners. Steps descended into this pool, and at the foot of the steps a lead pipe was found. The villa also had two facilities for heated baths, one at each end of the façade towards the sea.

Keywords  amphorae (storage vessels) flowerpots porticoes  House Description This site is east of the ancient town, 300 meters from the wall of High Empire times. It was found during an emergency salvage excavation of rue Séguier in 1992-93. An agricultural use of the soil during the second and first centuries B.C. is indicated by ceramics for carrying waste water to the fields and by planting holes. Then a building was constructed around A.D. 30 only to be rapidly abandoned between A.D. 70 and 80. The stones of the building were carried off at the end of the first century, and two burials made around 80-100. The house is organized around a rectangular courtyard (14.3 by 9 meters) surrounded by galleries known on three sides and presumed on the fourth. The floor of these passage ways was of pounded earth covered, in places, by a bed of fragments of amphora and dolia.
In the central part of the courtyard were found a series of horticultural pots, some in place in their trench, others uncovered during the excavation. A total of nine pots were found during the excavation of the whole sector. Three were discovered in situ in the courtyard against the north-west wall. Two more were found at the ends of the gallery in trenches dug after the house was abandoned to get out the stones of the adjacent walls. These pots the excavator placed in the corners. Two more have been restored in the alignment at equal distance from the others, modern operations having disrupted this part of the line. The excavator thus reconstructed a line of seven pots presumably for ornamental plantings along the outside of the portico.

Keywords  porticoes mosaics (visual works) exedrae (site elements) pilasters  House Description 390 meters north of the Maison Carrée, salvage excavations in 1966 found this dwelling dating from the high Empire and in use for some two centuries. The main entrance was probably on the south. The building was organized around a courtyard with porticos, paved with white mosaics, on three sides. From them, open the living spaces of the house. Onto the northern wing opens the principal room (19.6 square meters) in the form of an exedra flanked by two pilasters. It opens entirely onto the northern gallery. {What does “entirely” mean? }
At the time of the excavation, the central part of the courtyard (32.5 square meters) contained only earth. A trench cut at that time by V. Lassalle revealed a depression filled with stones which may indicate a pool that was suppressed at a later stage. The presence, in a first phase, of a garden with a pool of unknown size is possible. At a certain time, the courtyard was modified, destroying the pool and putting a wall on the line of the stylobate of the northern portico, thus reducing the view and the lighting of the principal room.

Keywords  vestibules courtyards peristyles (Roman courtyards) cisterns (plumbing components) opus sectile (visual works) porticoes  House Description This construction is situated in the southeast corner of Network B of the town plan, near the port. The parcel has a surface 8,422 square meters with 6,860 for the habitation properly speaking and a covered useful surface of 3390 square meters. The present construction goes back to the end of the first century B.C., between 30 and 10 B.C., but there was an anterior condition. The edifice was lavishly decorated and underwent multiple rearrangements in second century and then again in late antiquity.
At the north, a large vestibule gives access to a vast courtyard with a peristyle [2] of 41.5 meters by 45 meters around which the residence is organized. This court was not a garden but rather was paved with flagstones and sloped, according to Charles Texier, to collect the rain water into a mighty central subterranean cistern that was covered by a rectangular ornamental pool of 9.5 by 12.5 meters. This cistern would have made the residence self-sufficient in water. The peristyles and courts that led to the apartments with many rooms seem also to have had no gardens, for the surface was hard, either of concrete or opus sectile. It is on the outside that a garden would have been developed, on the south façade of the construction along a portico or gallery; the garden [26] of 900 square meters of arable land was limited by the rampart to the south. It would have offered a panorama on the port and plain.

Keywords  opus signinum reception rooms ditches water wells  House Description This site is 300 meters east of the big spring de la Fontaine at the foot of Mt. Cavalier. The house, discovered during an emergency dig in 1991-92, is not well preserved. Built in the middle of the first century, it seems to have existed until the middle of the second century. Though not very luxurious, it had however some opus signinum with geometric patterns of tessera. It is noteworthy, however, that in contrast to other houses in Nîmes of the same period, it seems to have had running water supplied by lead-lined canals in a utility tunnel in direct connection to the town water house. Covering a little more than 170 square meters, the dwelling is organized around a garden, which has been explored in an area of 8 by 6 meters, but which must have been somewhat longer and probably had an area of about 72 square meters. Along the east, west, and north sides ran galleries paved in opus signinum with inlays. On the north side, slightly off-center toward the west, there was a small reception room in the form of an exedra (4.8 by 3.8 m).
Planting in the garden is well attested by the discovery of nine horticultural pots of globular, ovoid, or truncated conical form made of a pale clay with three fairly large holes on the base of the pot. In all cases where the bottom was present, it had been scooped out before firing. {Does “scooped out” make sense?} They were found in place in circular ditches or at the extremities of long, parallel trenches which may have played a role in the irrigation of the plants. There seems to have been a certain symmetry in the placement of the pots relative to the two straight ditches.
The site had not been disturbed, whence the good state of preservation of the pots, but palynological analysis has not been able to establish the species of the plants on the basis of pollens. Post holes near the trenches, of which three have been identified thanks to wedging stones still in place, may indicate the presence of stakes to support climbing plants.
At the south of the garden there is a well which may have supplied the house before the connection to city water was installed; it could also have been used to water the garden. The absence of ceramic material in the ditches makes precise dating of them impossible, but the general context suggests a date in the first century A.D. for the establishment of the garden. A dump dug in the garden allows dating of one of the principal phases of occupation of the building to A.D. 60 to 90.

Keywords  stairs  House Description House C is 300 meters east of the source of the big spring at the foot of Mt. Cavalier, at the northwest point of an block of houses and bordered by a north-south road paved with flagstones. Built during the years A.D. 40 – 60, it seems to have been occupied until the middle of the second century. {I do not understand “IIe dernier”: “the second last.” ???} The surface explored during the salvage excavations in 1991 covers about 810 square meters, with about 300 square meters of useful covered surface. The eastern part is unknowable because of destruction by modern operations. This part would have brought the total surface to more than 1000 square meters. How the whole of the place worked together remains, however, very hard to follow, for there has been an almost total loss of the floors and thresholds of the living areas. At a break in the slope of the land on the north side was placed a utility tunnel with lead pipes for bringing in running water. It defines the northern limit of the house. On the south, a courtyard [1], associated with a frequently rearranged zone [2] was bordered on the north by a series of three rooms with floor levels differing by 70 cm to 1 meter. Such a pronounced difference in levels would imply stairs in front of these spaces, but none has been found. This courtyard of at least 111 square meters yielded only a few traces of the paleosol on the bedrock. In a circular pit 3.90 meters in diameter and a little off-center to the south, was a pool. While the outside was circular, the inside – the space filled with water &amp;ndash; was a hexagonal with 1.2 meter sides. Its 40-cm deep inside was lined with hydraulic cement, and its bottom rested on a series of limestone flagstones which seem to plug a round cistern (1.18 meters in diameter) which belonged to an earlier condition of the house. Flanking the pool on either side, two dolia {(large, ceramic, roughly spherical tanks)} may have stored water or served as planters.

Keywords  vestibules atriums porticoes fountains  House Description The house found under Formigé square lies 200 m south of the intersection of the cardo maximus and the decumanus maximus at 150 meters from the quays of the port. It is in the southwest quarter of Insula A of the network of the city. A parcel of 462 square meters has been recovered with a useful covered surface of about 342 square meters. To the south it is paralleled by a decumanus and by other habitations to the north and east. The principal entrance was probably on the south. What may be called the first stage of construction, though it replaced a previous condition, seems to go back to around A.D. 1 – 5. In this condition, it was occupied until A.D. 60 – 70. Its pavements have been preserved, along with a large part of its painted decoration up to a considerable height.
One enters the house on the south from the edge of the street by a wide entrance with a floor of pounded earth, which accommodates a bench. At the end of the vestibule, there is an atrium [2] of 9.2 by 10.54 meters, around which the house is organized. The impluvium was surrounded by low walls on which an imaginary garden was painted. In a second phase, nine planters filled with earth were arranged on three sides of the impluvium.
Around A.D. 65 – 70, the house entered a second stage which lasted three and a half centuries. It was enlarged over a two-meter deep fill on which was planted a garden [1] of 12.5 by 10 meters, framed by a portico [2] and bordered on the south by four rooms. The portico was 2.8 meters wide, including the stylobate. The courtyard of the first condition was transformed into a rectangular pool (9 by 2.2 m) divided into two parts by a low wall with a fountain to the north and two rectangular planters (each 1.7 by 0.7 m ) on the south.

Keywords  bathhouses (water recreation structures) vestibules columns (architectural elements) peristyles (Roman courtyards) porticoes reception rooms pergolas ditches  House Description This house was in a central residential quarter across the street (rue des Boutiques) from the public baths of the town center. Unearthed between 1924 and 1946, it occupied a parcel of 4354 square meters with a useful covered surface of 1957.3 square meters. The condition now shown goes back to the second half of the first century; though previous states are possible, nothing is known of them. It was subsequently occupied during at least two centuries. There was a fire and doubtless at least partial abandonment in the course of the third century. Its complex plan made it one of the largest grand homes of Vaison during the Flavian epoch. It groups together several elements of distinct origin: one or two houses to the east, one in the center, and a bath structure that was originally public. This development explains the different orientations of these buildings.
To the east, on the “rue des Boutiques,” was the principal entrance: a monumental vestibule paved with flagstones opened directly through a triple bay with two columns onto a peristyle [17] (13 by 8,50 m - 4 by 4 columns) of Tuscan order. The court was probably planted as a garden, but it had no pool. The western portico, somewhat wider than the others, underlined the importance of the reception room [16] which connected with the central part of the house.
A second garden [12] (15 by 13 m) was found in the southern part of the house, lying a meter below the main part and formed by rooms for lodging and reception, though their function is not altogether clear. This garden is dominated on the north by a portico with 7 columns; at each end a flight of steps descended to connect the house to covered walkways (with 5 columns) that extended south to form a U around the garden and delimit the house on this side, for there were no rooms attached. {I need the plan to be sure that I have understood “en U (7 x 5 colonnes)” correctly.} Along the portico on the north was a rectangular pool (10 by 1.5 meters) without water jets; it was originally covered with red tiles which are today much restored. A lead pipe, possibly for drainage, was noted during the excavation.
The spaces [13-14-15], on which little has been published, are badly preserved. Without any real certainty, [13] is considered a reception room at once having a dominating view onto the garden and opening directly past two columns onto a courtyard [14] (13 by 9.50 m) that was perhaps planted. Room [15] constitutes another room separated by a gallery and a portico from the other columns of the space [14]. The excavator, the abbot Sautel, proposed, without evident proof, to cover the space [13] with a pergola. The space [13-14-15], in the axis of the garden [12], formed an alternation of covered and open spaces giving air and light to the center of the house.
The western part of the house has been interpreted as a former public bath complex, with double baths (total surface of 2235 square meters), all subsequently incorporated into the house. The palestra of the bath was converted by the proprietor of the house into a large pleasure garden of 1590 square meters. Of trapezoidal form (36 x 30 m), it is bordered on four sides by a Tuscan portico 3.4 meters wide. Along all sides runs a trench lined with limestone for catching rainwater. The former natatio (14,50 x 4,40 m) in the southwest corner of the palestra became an ornamental pond with an east-west drainage ditch connecting to the sewer that crosses the peristyle.
Midway along the northern portico is placed just at the edge a well with a limestone top that is circular in the part that has been exposed.
In the northeast corner of the peristyle was discovered the famous silver bust which gives its name to the house. This 29.5 cm hight bust, now in the museum of Vaison-la-Romaine, was found in the context of the collapse of the roof of a burned portico. Along with it were found an Antonianus of Tetricus I {????} and two large lead plates of the roof. All of this would seem to give a general date for the abandonment of the garden.
To the north spread out the bath establishment, which continued to serve but as private baths. The space left free to the south of the baths has often been considered to have been a garden, but probably it was only a simple courtyard.
Finally, between the baths to the west and the “rue des boutiques,” the house is dominated on the north by a vast platform lying 3 to 4 meters higher. A rectangular pool (10 x 3,50 m) still preserved there ornamented, according to Sautel, another garden also related to the house, but this remains to be demonstrated. The lack of real excavation makes it impossible to say whether this space contained any construction.
A number of sculptural discoveries are noteworthy. In the vestibule [18] was found half of an oscillum 19 cm in diameter; on one face, a hare nibbles fruits coming out of a wicker basket while on the other are two dolphins in the water. In the east portico of the peristyle [17] was a fragmentary oscillum (26 cm long) in the form of a pelta; one horn terminates in the head of an eagle-griffon. On one of the faces is a mask of a bearded person in profile with frilly hair held by a band; on the reverse is a mask with wavy hair.

Keywords  praetoriums stairs porticoes water wells triclinia pergolas bathhouses (water recreation structures) colonnades  House Description This house stood southwest of the theater, on the Puymin hill, in the residential northeast quarter of the city. Unearthed between 1927 and 1929, it covered a surface of about 3000 square meters. A first stage was built around 40 – 30 B.C., followed by a considerable extension to the northeast in the first century A.D.. First interpreted as an official residence, a praetorium, by J. Sautel, it takes its present name from an arbor found in the garden. The house, organized on at least three levels, was considerably worn down so that interpreting the different phases is not easy.
Garden Description The residential part best known was organized around a garden 17 by 20 meters, framed by three wings in a U. At the center of the east wing, the bottom of the U, a grand stairway with two {curving?) symmetric ramps framing a niche (possibly for a statue) rose to the second storey where a portico overlooked the garden from three sides. To the west, the fourth side of the garden was closed against the outside by a straight wall. On it was supported a wall accented by a central apse (with a opening of 5.8 meters) centered on the axis of the garden. Along this wall, but separated from it by a space, lie three related pools which are below the garden. Built of masonry, one is semi-circular (3.85 meters in diameter) with a lateral set of stone steps for access, while the other two are symmetrically placed rectangles (2.4 by .85 meters). No water jet was noted. There was also a well with masonry rim in the southeastern part of the garden.
In the axis of the garden but a little off to the west is a structure with masonry walls in the form of a T, 7.15 m long. On top of this wall has been reconstructed without proof a T-shaped arbor shading the site of a summer triclinium. {Is this arbor “reconstitué” mentally or in wood ?} We believe that if there were here a pergola it would have covered a banquet space organized in a T + U shape and built of wood resting on the masonry of which only the T by itself is drawn. {Drawn in what sense?}
To the northeast of the house are remains in which it has been proposed to see a bath with a pool surrounded by a 3-by-5 colonnade. This pool could have also have served as a water reservoir for irrigation of the tree-covered slopes and gardens below the hill of Puymin.

Keywords  decumanus vestibules peristyles (Roman courtyards) opus signinum gutters (building drainage components)  House Description This house is 240 meters northeast of the Maison Carrée at the angle of rue Nationale and rue la Ferrage on a 250-square-meter parcel. Salvage excavations were conducted in 1978 – 79. The known surface exceeds 140 square meters and one can estimate its total surface to have been between 400 and 600 square meters. It was probably turned towards the decumanus on the south, under the present rue Nationale. The location of the entrance from the outside is not known, but one entered the courtyard by a vestibule on its south side. Construction goes back to the Augustan period, near the year A.D. 1. The house, remodeled in the second half of the first century, was occupied two or three centuries; strata dated from the fourth century indicate abandonment by that time. The best known part is the courtyard with peristyle of 62 square meters and ornamented in its center by a rectangular pool. The galleries were paved in opus signinum sown with little crosses of black tessera.
Only about half of the rather deep pool has survived. The base of a fountain is found to the east of the pool. A gutter leads from this base towards the southeast corner of the peristyle.

Keywords  porticoes triclinia water wells  Garden Description This vast house lies 120 m southwest of the theater in the southern quarter of the ancient town at a place called le pinard, “the wine” from the pinot grape. Partially excavated in 1967-1968, it is still not entirely unearthed. The known portions extend over 1250 m2 of which 715 m2 are useful covered area. The last state is dated to the second century, but one may well suppose that there were earlier states not yet studied or exposed.
The natural slope of the terrain towards the east led to building the house in levels around a central garden [9]. On three sides – north, south, and west – the garden is bordered by a gallery perhaps with a second floor above. The fourth, lower side was closed by a wall. The almost square courtyard, about 17.5 m on each side, was certainly treated as a garden. An ornamental pool is centered on the reception wing on the west side, which is dominated by a large triclinium [6] which opens onto the garden by a large bay. This rectangular pool is about 11 m in length and has the peculiarity that its bottom has two levels differing by about 20 cm although the water surface of the pool is all on the same level. It is terminated on the western, uphill side by a little semicircular apse surmounted by a niche in a mass of masonry. This little structure does not seem to have been intended to be viewed from the triclinium but from the other end of the garden. Into this masonry is integrated a well about 10 m deep, cut into the marl, which functions at the same time as the pool.

Excavated in 1967-1968, the parcel covers 450 sq m, with a useful covered surface of 401.5 sq m. It was constructed in the second century. Only the southwest corner is known; the rest is lost or not excavated.
On entering from the east-west street, after passing through two incidental rooms, one comes into a vast space [1] occupied by a pool of about 2.5 x 3.5 m connected by a ditch to the sewer in the street. This room, in which some see an atrium (?), may be a vestibule with pool connecting with the entrance of which the tower may have been treated as a garden (?). [This makes no sense to me; how can a tower be treated as a garden? Maybe “tour” (tower) was supposed to be “cour” (courtyard).]

Keywords  bathhouses (water recreation structures) peristyles (Roman courtyards) porticoes domus  House Description This house is in the eastern quarter of the town, near the temple of the Basaltes, 200 m to the west of the forum. It lies 35 m to the south of the apparently private baths of la Planchette, near the temple of the Basaltes. Excavated in 1983-1984, the walls are for the most part destroyed down to the level of the foundations. The house covers an area of 632.5 sq m, with a usable covered surface of 356.9 sq m. After a previous state not well known, it was rebuilt between 10 and 20 A.D.. It saw several phases before being abandoned at the end of the third century. The eastern part of the house is unknown.
At the end of the Augustan epoch, a courtyard occupied the southern part of the area, without doubt an area free of construction with an entrance porch on the south [7]. Later, it was rearranged with a space [4] on the west which was long considered agricultural.
A peristyle [15] seems to be starting off towards the north, but its limits are unknown. The stylobate delimiting the west branch of the portico [14] was constructed only in the Flavian period. We know only the southwest corner of the peristyle, however the nature of the surface of the open space has not been ascertained.
At first, this relatively modest dwelling was thought to have perhaps belonged to an artisan or peasant. But the presence of the private baths to the northeast opens the possibility of seeing in it a part of a great domus with porticos and a grand central garden and associated baths. There is, however, a discrepancy between the luxury of the baths and the simplicity of the excavated area of the house, which seems to have been a service or common area.

Keywords  domus porticoes statues gutters (building drainage components) columns (architectural elements)  Garden Description Located to the east of the house of the Laurel-crowned Apollo, 110 meters south of the theater, the Sanctuary with Porticos is not entirely unearthed and continues under the modern city. Constructed in the course of the first century A.D., the monument was formerly interpreted as a public promenade or a the garden of a vast urban domus. Today it is considered a public edifice, a sanctuary connected perhaps to the cult of the waters. Covering 2,000 to 3,000 square meters, it was organized in at least two terraces overlooking an esplanade with porticos having a large, central, ornamental pool which was probably surrounded by plantings. A street-level, covered walkway of Tuscan order ran 52 meters along the north side, elevated 20 centimeters relative to the garden. In the center of this walkway was a room with an apse holding a central pedestal and two symmetric niches for statues.
A stone gutter to catch rainwater separated the walkway from the garden. One entered the garden through a porch having two columns more massive than the others which supported, no doubt, a higher pediment.
In the center of the court was a monumental pool 9.5 meters wide and 1.6 meters deep, as yet exposed for only 3.1 meters of its length. A large apse ornamented its northern end, and its bottom was paved with flagstones. Necks and bellies of terracotta amphora were inserted horizontally into the masonry to shelter fish. In the center of the pool, a masonry construction with walls 60 centimeters thick seems to have supported a small structure with two square rooms 5.25 meters on a side, perhaps a chapel. Stairs go down into the pool on the west side.

Keywords  decumanus mosaics (visual works) cubicula (domestic spaces) columns (architectural elements) pilasters porticoes colonnades  House Description House A1, called the House of Clodius, is bordered on the north by a secondary decumanus and has a common wall with other houses on three sides. It seems to have occupied an area of a little more than 450 square meters, but exploration is incomplete on the northeast because of the limits imposed on the excavation. The edifice reached us in very bad condition with many of the stones of its walls carried off. It was built in the Augustan period, somewhere between 10 B.C. and 10 A.D. and was destroyed in 20-30 A.D., perhaps in a flood that struck the town in about 30, as in the quarter of the Cours Pourtoules. In one of the rooms, an inscription in tesserae reads CLODIVS, perhaps gives the name of the proprietor.
The house has an L shape. The rooms were along the north and east side of a rectangular courtyard of nearly 120 square meters; its purpose may have been utility or pleasure. The northern wing was divided relatively symmetrically with a series of residential rooms of large dimensions. This wing was dominated by a large reception room in plan like an up-side-down T (when viewed from the courtyard), which probably served as the triclinium. The rectangle which bounded the T was flanked by two smaller rectangular rooms which, to judge by the two-part mosaic on the floor, would seem to have been cubicula &amp;ndash; bedrooms. (The bed went over the rather plain mosaic, while the elaborate one was free to be enjoyed.)
The presumed triclinium opened through a wide entrance, flanked on either side by a column or pilaster (of which only the bases were found), onto a portico with a colonnade. The space between the columns widened at this point to give an uninterrupted view of the courtyard from the triclinium, a detail which would seem to support the interpretation of the courtyard as a garden.

Keywords  peristyles (columnades) columns (architectural elements) reception rooms mosaics (visual works) gutters (building drainage components) porticoes opus signinum  House Description Some years after the destruction by flood of the house of Clodius (NAR15.10), and its neighbor (House A2), their ruins were leveled and this house built upon them. Some authorities place the construction in the last third of the first century, around the year 70; others, sometime in the second century. The dwelling seems to have lasted until about 260-280.
Garden Description The garden was in the square peristyle (9.7 m on a side) with six Corinthian columns on a side. (The east corner has not be found, but can be confidently conjectured, along with the fourth gallery.) The reception room [a] (of nearly 50 sq. m.) was ornamented with a black and white mosaics with meanders of alternating swastikas and squares, filled in with floral motifs, chalices and hederae (ivy). Slightly off-center relative to the garden, it opens through a large bay onto the north gallery of the peristyle, which also has a mosaic. This northern gallery was of the Rhodian type to open a larger view from the main room onto the garden. Just inside the peristyle, a gutter of cut stone caught rainwater from the roofs of the porticoes. A rectangular pool (7.4 x 2.5 m. and less than 70 or 80 cm. deep) running the full length of the north side of the garden occupied more than a third of its space. It was lined in opus signinum and had masonry quarterround in the edges to make them watertight. It was incompletely excavated on the south side and could well have had there a semicircular apse as in the neighboring House with the Polychrome Mosaic. Probably it had a well, as in other parts of Orange, but none has been located. Lying in the pool was found a collection of fragments of lead piping. Presumably, they had been pulled together after the house was abandoned with the intent to reuse them. These pieces permit the conjectural partial reconstruction of the water supply to the pool. The water came, it seems, in a pipe of average diameter, to the northeast corner of the pool, then passed through a truncated cone and came out through a curved section of smaller diameter. The purpose would seem to be to create the pressure necessary for a water jet in a fountain. A rather large sewer collector (30 x 40 cm in section) took the rainwater of the roofs and the overflow of the pool from the northeast corner of the garden and led them away to the north, picking up along the way the waste water of the baths. The overflow from the pool may perhaps have assured the necessary flux in latrines near the baths.

Keywords  porticoes mosaics (visual works) porticoes  House Description Excavations in 1964-1969 on the site of the former [or ancient] church of St. Peter brought partially to light a building with an area of about 1200 sq m. It was constructed towards the end of the first or beginning of the second century, but it is unclear whether it was public or private.
The western wing, of which 30 m is known, has rooms richly decorated with marble plaques, painted surfaces, and white mosaics. It borders a courtyard organized around a rectangular pool. The large room [1] (10.2 x 8 m) is centered on this pool and opens onto a portico with mosaics [5] 3.30 m wide. Against the portico, in the axis of the room [1] was placed a small, almost square pool, 2.40 x 2.6 m. A second pool, dug into the ground of courtyard, measures 8.30 x 12 m. Its walls and surroundings are made of large, rectangular limestone blocks. The limits of the space decorated by this pool are not known.

Keywords  mosaics (visual works) reception rooms porticoes fountains pilasters gutters (building drainage components)  Villa Description TThis building, thought to be a suburban villa, is in fact only very partially known. It is situated just at the edge of the town, below the “shopping quarter”. Discovered on property of the Thès family in 1964, it was excavated and studied from 1966 to 1989. The dwelling was built, according to Yves de Kisch, between approximately A.D. 70 and 100. In the Severin period, according to H. Lavagne, it received a rich decoration of homogeneous mosaics. Abandoned at the end of the third century, it shows traces of reoccupation in late antiquity. Only the northern part of the house is known; the wings to the east and west and the southern part were destroyed in the course of earth moving for a modern subdivision. The northern wing is constructed symmetrically relative to the axis of the principal reception room [4], where the peacock mosaic was found which gives the house its name. On the south, this room opened directly, without a portico, onto the courtyard, (25.5 m in the east-west direction) which was undoubtedly treated as a garden. The southern limit is unknown, but a hypothetical reconstruction has made it a rectangle with an area of some 1000 square meters, which seems on the high side. An ornamental fountain, now in ruins, stood in a pool in front of the reception room [4]. Of the fountain there remains only a block of concrete surrounded on three sides by a trench 18 centimeters deep. The pool had a marble revetment, and around it were three flagstones of white molasse (a soft sandstone.) The whole structure occupied a space 4 meters by 1.5 meters. The fountain was fed by a lead pipe, of which a fragment was found.
The façade of the back of the building opened to north by a portico [4], 3.45 meters wide. Beyond it lay an elongated courtyard (38.15 by 5.50 m) paved with concrete. An ornamental fountain with a water ladder was installed in a niche in the middle of the retaining wall in line with the center of the reception room. The top of the semi-dome of the niche has been found. Water supplied through a lead pipe gurgled over white marble steps framed between pilasters, spilled into a polygonal pool about 2.5 meters long, then rushed along a steeply sloped gutter under the reception room and into the courtyard on the south.

House Tower Enclosure, Insula III, House IIIA – 3 phases
Keywords  porticoes reception rooms domus water wells courtyards fountains water wells vestibules  House Description This house is 65 meters south of the rampart and 120 meters to the west of the theater. It occupies the northeast corner of an insula in network B, in the northeast quarter of the city. The house occupies a parcel of 192 square meters, with a useful covered area of 85.5 square meters. It was bordered on the north by a decumanus and on the east by a cardo with porticos. To the west and south, it had common walls with other habitations. Constructed around A.D. 20-25, the house continued in use for 40 – 45 years.
In the first phase, the house was composed of large rooms around an open space (10 by 5.5 m) that was perhaps a garden [4]. In the northeast corner there was a square masonry mass, 1.6 meters on a side, of unknown function. The court is bordered on the north by a portico [5] 10 meters long and 2.6 meters wide, which connected the rooms on that side of the house. {Literally, “which played the role of space for circulation in leading to the rooms of habitation to the north.”} In the axis of the entrance was the principal reception room.
In a second phase, around A.D. 70, houses IIIa and IIIa’’ were combined. The structure is called “House with the Greek style mosaic.” This new domus occupied a parcel of 375 square meters with a useful covered surface of 199.5 square meters. It adopted an L-shaped plan completed by a rectangular (15.3 by 6 m) garden [1] of 104.5 square meters. The north side of the garden is paralleled by a portico [2] 1.7 meters wide, which provides access to four rooms. In the southwest of the garden there was a well and in line with it one of the principal rooms of the house was arranged. {This makes little sense to me; how can a room be in line with a well? But a literal translation is worse: “… there was a well, in the axis of which one of the principal rooms of the house was arranged.” If the well is round, it has only one axis, and that is vertical! The plan might help.}
In a third and final phase, dated from around the end of the second century, the surface of the parcel grew to 401 square meters, with a useful covered surface 265 square meters. The oecus, or formal dining room, opened through a large bay to the south onto the garden. This courtyard of about 10 by 5.7 meters was certainly treated as a garden. {I do not understand the parenthesis. It seems to be a question by the author to himself.} A small pool of white marble, which runs along the west wing is fed from the north by a water jet that made a fountain. Drainage was through a lead pipe. Behind it was a second pool; at the back, against the wall, it had a narrow space filled with dirt, perhaps a planter for plants to mask the wall which was certainly without openings. This pool, of about 5.7 by 2.1 meters overall, was divided into two by a low wall and included a well at this level. The wall of the south façade is bordered by a drainage gutter. The courtyard was framed on two sides, north and west, by a portico with a space of 2.2 meters between columns, with the third {what?} to the east {from the east?} serving as a vestibule [1]. {I need the plan to know what is being said.} By the large door, one enters the eastern end of a portico 2 meters wide which opens onto the courtyard through a row of brick columns covered with stucco. The west wing has four rooms; the largest, ceremonial room [4] looked out onto the garden with the pool straight ahead.

Province Description The frontier between Numidia and Mauretania fluctuated during early the African kingdoms. It was fixed at the river of Ampsaga during Caesar’s reign when he rewarded his ally King Bocchus, giving him part of the Numidian kingdom. By 31 BCE, Numidia (also known as Africa Nova) was under direct Roman control, becoming attached to the province of Africa Proconsularis. Toward 194 CE, Septimus Severus detached most of the Numidia territory from the province of Africa Proconsularis, forming a special province governed from Cirta by a procurator, subordinate to the imperial legate. With the Diocletian reforms, the whole of Roman Africa (with exception of Mauretania Tingitana) constituted a single diocese subdivided into six provinces, including Numidia Cirtensis with Cirta as capital.

The city had a checker-board plan, measuring approximately 11 hectares (27 acres) total, containing a forum with Curia, an imperial temple, and a basilica. Between the second and fourth centuries, the city expanded from its original layout. Additional temples and baths were built, and the center of the city was expanded with the construction of luxurious houses, a library, and a new market. At the end of the fourth century, bishop Optatus of Timgad, a prominent member of the Donatist church, constructed the great west basilica. During the Byzantine conquest, a fortress was erected on the water sanctuary; the original site dating to the third or fourth century.

The plan presents a complex layout notably in the southern part of the domus upon which the excavators did not comment thoroughly (Plan view, Fig. 1).
The S part of the domus was probably added in a latter period. It presents a peristyle (B) on which a reception room (C) projected and a series of galleries terminating with an apsidal form. The N peristyle (A) had four porticoes, the S gallery was a continuous colonnade that crossed the W and E porticoes. On the N and W, a vestibule and reception rooms opened towards the peristyle (A). A large rectangular basin oriented NS was placed on the axis of the vestibule, which projected into the courtyard. It seems that the S reception room (C) opened also toward the N peristyle (A). Along the NS axis a semi-circular basin projecting into the peristyle (B) and facing a reception room was placed in between the fourth and the fifth columns. The courtyards of the peristyles may have been planted.

In the center was the forum with its Curia, an imperial temple and the basilica. Between the IInd and the IVth century the city expanded out of its original layout. Temples, baths and a market were built and the center of the city was renovated with the construction of the library, the market and luxurious houses. At the end of the IVth century the bishop Optatus of Timgad a prominent member of the donatist church constructed the great west basilica. During the Byzantine conquest a fortress was erected on the water sanctuary dating to the IIIrd and IVth century.
Garden Water Sanctuary Aqua Eptimania Felix (Sanctuaire des eaux)
Keywords  mural paintings (visual works) porticoes viridarium  Garden Description The water sanctuary lies beneath the Byzantine fort in the Northern suburbs of the city. An inscription that was discovered during the Byzantine fort excavations enumerates the embellishments that were undertaken in 213 by the city of Timgad for the sanctuary, Aqua Septimania Felix: one of which, a bronze balustrade surrounding the spring (a pool with marble slabs of 3,6 m x 13, 60 m) and a viridarium surrounded by porticoes decorated with paintings (porticus virdiari (sic) picturis ornatas). But the central space of the vast porticoed monument discovered to the North of the fort is paved, this has lead L. Leschi, in order to explain the viridarium designation, to consider that the paintings of the porticoes were garden paintings.

Garden Funerary Grove of Q. Cervonius Chryseros
Keywords  tombs stelae grove (sacred grove) altars (religious fixtures)  Garden Description A small inscribed altar of (probably) the Julio-Claudian era found by Mommsen among the stones of Aquileia and now lost records on its left and right sides dedications to Dis Pater and (H)era respectively and, on its front, the name of the dedicant, a consul’s aide (acc(ensus) co(n)s(ularis)) and local sevir at Florentia, Q. Cervonius Chryseros, who built “the grove, the enclosure wall, the altars, the mound (? molem), and the seats” (lucum, maceriem, aras, molem, [s]edilia). The dedication to Dis Pater suggests a funerary context, which leads Chioffi to identify the molis as a tomb monument of some ill-defined type (perhaps an irregular mound?). A Roman soldier serving in lower Germany at Carvium (Herwen) was buried by his two heirs ad molem, “near (or at) the mound” (AE 1939, 130). The same Chryseros perhaps appears as the owner of a slave, Fausta, who in fulfillment of a vow dedicated another monument to Dis Pater at Aquileia (CIL 5.35*).

      <description>Province Hispania Tarraconensis
Tarraconensis(Pleiades)
Province Description In 236 BC, to offset Carthage&amp;rsquo;s loss of Sicily and Sardinia in the First Punic War, Hamilcar Barca led an expedition into Hispania to establish a colony there. Through force of arms and diplomacy, he spread Carthaginian influence as far north as Barcellona, which bears his name. In 230 BC, Hasdrubal, his son-in-law, established Qart Hadast that became Carthago Nova in Roman times and Cartagena today. After the death of Hasdrubal, Hannibal, Hamilcar&amp;rsquo;s oldest son, took command, attacked Saguntum, and in 218 set out for Italy leaving his younger brother, Hasdrubal, in command in Spain. Through the Alps, he descended into Italy and threatened Rome for fourteen years. Roman armies under the brothers Gnaeus and Publius Cornelius Scipio kept Hasdrubal in check and prevented his reinforcing Hannibal. They were both killed by the Carthaginians in 212. Two years later, another Publius Cornelius Scipio, the 25-year-old son of the late general of the same name, was sent to Spain. The next year, he captured New Carthage and, in 206 at the battle of Ilipa (about 15 km north of Savilla) destroyed most of the Carthaginians&amp;rsquo; numerically superior army and ended their hold on Spain. Scipio settled his wounded veterans nearby at a place he called Italica to remind them of their origins. Today, it is one of the best Roman archaeological sites in Italy. After a quick trip back to Rome, where he was elected consul, he returned to Spain and went on to attack Carthage itself. Hannibal was recalled to Africa, but Scipio annihilated his army in 202. Rome thus came into possession of the Mediterranean coast of Iberia.
If Rome was drawn into Hispania to keep the Carthaginians there from supporting Hannibal in Italy, it missed the opportunity offered by Hannibal&amp;rsquo;s defeat to get out of Spain honorably. Instead, in 197 BC it created two new Roman provinces, Hispania Citerior whose capital was Carthago Nova and Hispania Ulterior with Corduba as its capital. Soon after, Rome launched a long war to subjugate the Lusitani, Celtiberians on the west coast. During Sulla&amp;rsquo;s dictatorship, the Lusitani were again in revolt, this time under the able leadership of the Roman general Quintus Sertorius, who sought to create an independent, Roman-like state in Hispania. He established a senate and schools for the sons of the local nobility.
Augustus&amp;rsquo;s conquest of Hispania produced a new territorial division that replaced the earlier two-province organization of the region. Augustus divided the whole of the peninsula into three provinces: Hispania Citerior or Tarraconensis, with its capital Tarraco (Tarragona); Hispania Ulterior Baetica, with its capital Corduba (Córdoba); and Hispania Ulterior Lusitania, or Emerita Augusta, with its capital Mérida. The provinces, in turn, were subdivided in administrative legal units, or conventus. The western lands stayed part of the newly demarcated Lusitania, areas into which Romanization had hardly penetrated, in contrast to the other areas of the peninsula where the classical tradition had been incorporated quite early. This division lasted until late antiquity, when Tarraconensis was subdivided into three provinces: Tarraconensis, whose capital continued to be Tarraco (Tarragona), Carthaginiensis, with Carthago Nova (Catagena) as its capital, and Gallaecia, whose capital was Bracara Augusta (Braga, in northern Portugal).
The Mediterranean trio of wine, oil and cereals are the crops most frequently mentioned by all the classical authors when referring to the Iberian Peninsula. These were not the only plants cultivated here. Trogus Pompey, in his Universal History (44. 1-2), praises, as well as those products, the fertility of the soil itself, the benevolence of its climate, the opportune and abundant rains which enable all types of fruits to be gathered, thus supplying every need. He describes the linen and esparto grass as of the highest quality. Strabo recorded the tradition of irrigation as a common practice in pre-Roman agriculture (Strabo 3.2.5). This was continued by the Romans, as shown by the number of aqueducts, dams and small reservoirs still to be found on Spanish soil. Pliny, during his stay as procurator in Spain in the first century, gives more specific descriptions of the flora throughout his Natural History (Book XVI). Martial (Epigrams II) refers to myrtle, box and laurel, as common elements to be found in the garden of country houses in Spain.
It is not strange, therefore, that gardening, the work of the topiarius, was usual in Iberian houses, as this study shows. It was not, however, totally new to Spanish territory. Although there are no literary references to gardening in the Pre-Roman era, it must have been part of Iberian culture, as is proved in an unusual way in the northwest of the peninsula in the area under the influence of Greek culture from the city of Emporion (Ampurias or Empuriae). A Hellenic establishment there, Rhode (Rosas), in the third century BC minted drachmas with a rose as the emblem. There were sacred woods connected with the cities. Close to Augustas Emeritas was Lucus Feroniae. Dedicated to Augustus was Lucus Augusti, which gave rise to the present-day Lugo, in Galicia, and another Lucus existed in the environs of Gijón, the Lugo de Llanera (Blázquez, p. 24).
There has been little research on the gardens in the Roman settlements in Spain and Portugal. In drawing up the list of sites with gardens for this catalog, we have accepted that a garden existed when it was so labeled by the excavators. There are, however, many other probable gardens which we have included. Gorges found just under forty villas where enough remained to draw a plan. In them, certain features help to identify a garden. A peristyle alerts us to suspect a garden, but peristyle courtyards were sometimes paved with stones or bricks over a layer of lime. They were clearly not gardens. But if the courtyard had soil in it, it was in all probability a garden. Fountains, fountain statues, and pools are typical of a garden since water is indispensable for a garden. Most peristyles in Roman villas in Spain had ornamental irrigation channels, semicircular pools, wells or pools that gave the impression of still water that, nevertheless, endowed the garden with a cool humidity that favored the cultivation of plants. In Spain, peristyles with drainage are found in the first and second centuries AD and are also common in the late Empire. Certain types of statuary intimately connected with vegetation and nature are found in gardens, such as divinities related to Bacchus and his circle. At Pompeii, Diana, a garden goddess, sometimes paired with Apollo, is also found. Herms were placed on pilasters, as the examples in situ from Pompeii show. Characteristic of Roman villas was the way in which they opened out to the countryside onto a grand vista of gardens and parks filled with fountains.
The roughly triangular province of Tarraconensis, by far the largest of the three provinces of the Iberian Peninsula, stretched across the north side of modern Spain and down the east coast as far as Almeria. On the Atlantic coast, it reached as far south as present Oporto.

  Location Emporiae
Emporiae (Pleiades)
Location Description As Strabo (3.4.8) tells us, Greeks from Phokaia, by way of Massalia (Marseilles), established a market town (Emporion) here. Archaeology gives a date of approximately 575- 550 BC. The original settlement was on an island in the mouth of the Fluvià River. About 550, the settlement began to spread south onto the mainland, and the original settlement became known as Palaiapolis, the Old City. For clarity, archaeologists have given this Greek settlement on the mainland the corresponding name of Neapolis, New City. The plural form of the Latin name for the area – Emporiae, “markets” – reflects the dual nature of the city. Though literary sources mention other Greek settlements along the coast of the Iberian Peninsula, this is the only one known archaeologically.
Not only was Emporion the point of first contact between the Celtoiberians and Hellenic civilization, it was also here that, in 218 B.C., Roman armies first entered Iberia. The Roman consul Publius Cornelius Scipio reached Massalia too late to intercept Hannibal on his march into Italy, so he dispatched his brother Cnaeus with part of his forces to Emporion to cut Hannibal&amp;rsquo;s supply lines, while he himself returned to engage the Carthaginian in the Po valley.
Neapolis was settled from north to south. The oldest parts date from before 550 BC. The oldest part of the city wall come from 450 – 425 BC. The Asklepion in the southwest corner was built in the 400 -350 BC period, as a reorganization of an older sanctuary. In the years 375 – 350 BC, a new wall extended farther south. The 2nd century BC saw major building programs. The wall was again extended southwards. A new agora was formed, and the Asklepion reorganized. Public baths were built in the northeastern part of the city about 100 BC. A Serapium was built in the southeastern corner in the first century B.C. Around 100 B.C., a Roman city surrounded by a wall (750 x 350 m) was built on a hill about 150 meters west of Neapolis where there had previously been a structure that was probably the Roman praesidium. We will refer to this area as the Roman City; it is also called the Republican City . Streets were laid out in a rectangular grid, and a large forum occupied the center of the southern half. Just outside the south wall were an amphitheater and a palaestra. Three large houses, two of them with gardens, have been found northeast of the forum and one to the southeast of it. The northern half of the city remains unexcavated. Once development of the Roman City began, Neapolis seems to have been little changed. The two walls between them were dismantled, but – rather strangely – replaced by a single wall, probably in connection with the creation of the Municipium Emporiae in about 36 – 27 B.C.
Neapolis was abandoned in the course of the second half of the first century AD. The Roman City seems to have ceased development at about that time but remained inhabited to nearly the end of the third century. This abandonment of a once-thriving trading town is probably connected with the silting up of the harbor. The mouth of the Fluvià River has shifted seven kilometers to the north, while Palaiapolis, once an island, is now a hill rising out of lowland where the harbor once was.
Publicly funded excavation of the northeastern part of Neapolis and the forum of the Roman City was conducted in 1846-8. Further systematic studies were conducted from 1908 to 1936 under E. Gandía, who took a great interest in stratigraphy before it was common to do so. The Spanish Civil War brought this work to an end, but Gandía&amp;rsquo;s day books have been preserved. Work was resumed in the 1940&amp;rsquo;s and 1950&amp;rsquo;s by M. Almagro, with recent work by R. Mar and J. Ruiz de Arbulo, and B. Tang. Tang emphasizes that it is often difficult or impossible to determine whether a space in a house in Neapolis was open or covered. The difficulty should not be so great in the case of gardens, for any sort of paving or hammered earth rules out the possibility of a garden. She identifies gardens in N5 and N7 and notes that also N 52 near the northern end of the western edge and N 75 on the northern edge “appear to have been provided with gardens or terraces.”

Sublocation Description The discovery of the Laurentinum
The Laurentinum was a villa belonging to Pliny the Younger (PLIN. epist. 2.17). It was described in a letter directed to one of his friends, a certain Gallo, whom he invited there to spend some time together. In this letter Pliny described accurately his Laurentine maritime residence. Throughout the centuries, having read this letter, many architects and scholars tried their hand at reconstructing its plan. I did one myself, which - as I discovered later on - was not exactly right, but at least it proved to be as good an approximation as it could be expected. Knowing of this reconstruction, Prof. Antonio Maria Colini, who in 1935 had excavated the so-called Pliny&amp;rsquo;s Villa of Castel Fusano (COLINI 1985), asked me if it was possible to confront it with the plan of the Castel Fusano excavation. He wanted to check if there was any chance that, also if greatly modified during the centuries, this one could be the real Laurentinum. Lanciani, at least, had so declared and, after his statement, the fact was not discussed any more. It did not take too long to decide that the Castel Fusano Villa had nothing in common with the Laurentinum and that no transformation brought to it throughout the centuries could ever made it look as it looked. At this moment to locate the real Laurentinum was a challenge one couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist. With all that had been discovered and all the elements that were now at hand, finding it couldn&amp;rsquo;t really pose great problems. In fact Pliny gave its topographical localization quite clearly. First of all he told his friend that his residence was situated 17 miles from Rome and that it could be reached by two roads: the Laurentina and the Ostiensis. After 11 mile one had to leave the Ostiensis and take a dirt track; as for the Laurentina, after 14 mile one would find another dirt track leading to Pliny’s villa. This meant two things: first of all that the trip would have had the same length through the two itineraries, and second that the villa was placed on the stretch of coast which was limited by the two roads. Only in this case one could have used both for getting there. Pliny told also something else that was very important: he told his friend that his villa was the second one starting from a village which was in this area, but he didn&amp;rsquo;t say if it was towards Ostia or towards Antium. At the end of the XIX century the village was found. As the Municipality of Rome had bought the property of the Chigi family at Castel Fusano, where a villa - the second one towards Ostia starting from the village - had been found, it was decided to excavate it. As we have just seen it proved not to be Pliny&amp;rsquo;s one. So I concluded that the Laurentinum had to be the second one toward Antium, the so-called Villa Magna (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1984; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1987, pp. 182-184, figs. 35-37). Proofs of this were gathered. First of all topographical ones. We knew the layout of the ancient Ostiensis and Laurentina roads. Thus one could easily mark on a map the place where these roads had to be left. It is evident that these places could be considered two points of a triangulation. At this moment one had only to take a compass, point it on the spots where to leave the Ostiensis and take an opening corresponding to six mile. After this do the same for the Laurentina with an opening of three miles and trace the two arches. They would cross on the spot were Pliny&amp;rsquo;s Villa had been. When I did it the arches crossed just on the Villa Magna. A survey proved that everything Pliny had depicted in his letter tallied with the remains of the villa, and also the description of his gardens (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1985; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1987a).
Garden The garden on the back
Keywords  villa courtyards  Garden Description Excavating the garden of the Laurentinum would have been very interesting, but there was not the time, nor the money. However we found where it was: a rectangular area free from masonry set, as the letter said, on the back of the famous cryptoporticus, one of the principal highlights of the Laurentine. Pliny told us that a long vine trellis ran along this building and that mulberry trees and figs grew in the garden. Thus the place, with its fruit trees, must have been pleasingly rustic. There was also a long hedge of box trees. Rosemary took the place of buxum every time the bushes had to be exposed to the sea winds. As Pliny explained, buxum couldn&amp;rsquo;t stand the salt and, when exposed to it, it quickly dried up and died, while rosemary thrived on the coast. This description we just reported was the one that Pliny gave us. From what we see now, it appears that, after Pliny&amp;rsquo;s death and the selling of his maritime residence, the new owners brought many changes to it. Today high heaps of soil surround the garden&amp;rsquo;s area and, even though this part has not been excavated, it is evident that some masonry structure must be buried under it. It is highly probable that the vine trellises, and the rustic enclosures of Pliny&amp;rsquo;s times, were substituted by a marble portico which transformed the simple garden in a more elegant peristyle one. Evidently at this moment mulberry trees and figs must have been quickly replaced by less useful but more decorative plants.

It was set in front of the luminous cryptoporticus with all its windows open toward the Tyrrenian Sea. The two elements ran parallel to the coast. Only the terrace&amp;rsquo;s low wall protected them from the sand that the southwest wind and the frequent winter&amp;rsquo;s gales piled up against the villa. Sheltered by the masonry, masses of perfumed violets grew all along this parapet. Today only few remains of the terrace are still to be seen. The place had been changed in Severian times (Fig. 103). Part of the terrace was covered and joined to the famous cryptoporticus. A simple transfer brought the ancient seaside wall with its extra large windows on what once was the terrace&amp;rsquo;s parapet and pillars took the places of the windows in the ancient cryptoporticus, creating either a covered double portico or a large hall (Fig. 104). A small private bath was erected directly on the beach and was attached to this hall. Probably it took the place of Pliny&amp;rsquo;s Heliocaminus, a solarium which Pliny described. In this part the terrace was quite completely obliterated. Luckily a small part of it was preserved, and here we still find the low parapet against which the violets were and a stele (Fig 104, D) with an epigraph giving us the name of the family that bought the house after Pliny&amp;rsquo;s death. Also in this reduced state, the remains still retain the poetry of Pliny&amp;rsquo;s description. However it is always possible, basing ourselves on these remains and on Pliny&amp;rsquo;s letter, to reconstruct how the cryptoporticus and the terrace were at his times. For one thing the cryptoporticus described by Pliny is still saved and intact with delicate frescoes on its wall and an Augustan mosaic on its floor. Moreover it is still on the same line with his beloved pavilions, just as he described it in his letter, when he wrote that from the pavilion door he could overview all the length of the monumental cryptoporticus. Also the terrace is in line with it. Thus, omitting the Severian additions and destruction, we can redesign the plan of this part of the house with the garden, the cryptoporticus and the terrace set how they were once (Fig. 102).

House Edifice on St. Antoine’s Mound
Keywords  praetoriums courtyards porticoes peristyles (columnades) peristyles (Roman courtyards)  House Description This grand residential edifice may be either a public building or a great mansion. Built on St. Antoine’s mound, it is situated in the southwest corner of network A of the town plan. In immediate proximity of the port, it was first interpreded as the praetorium of the naval arsenal (A. Donnadieu 1932). Then it was assigned the role of residence of the perfect of the fleet or the occasional palace for the governor of the province (P.-A. Février, 1977). Less luxurious than the edifice of the platform (see below), it has been classified in the recent l’Atlas topographique de Fréjus among the public buildings of the city.
Less than half of the plan is known. The residence occupied more than 15,000 square meters, of which at least 6,000 were living space. The construction appears to go back to the first century B.C. with a poorly known prior condition.
The house was organized around a principal courtyard with porticos [1] with concrete floors. Composed of very many rooms, the mansion had a very large axial ceremonial room and four dwelling units, two of which were organized around peristyles leading to the apartments. Only peristyle [11] (5 x 10 m) can have had a garden; it is ornamented by a square pool with a frame about 1.30 meters long on each side.
The residence perhaps enjoyed an exterior garden in the vast open space of arable land along the eastern side of the construction. As in the intervallum of the military camps, some see in the open space a extensive garden estimated at 2,600 square meters. Irregular in shape and enclosed within the rampart, it overlooks the port.

Although covered with paving stones in the final phase, the courtyard may have been a garden in an earlier phase, for it had a pool in the center. This pool of an unusal, quadrilobe shape, was 9 meters long and covered in gray marble. This marble was reduced practically to chalk when the house burned. The pool was then used as a dump and was found filled with materials from the time of the invasions.

Keywords  courtyards porticoes mosaics (visual works) statuettes (free-standing sculpture) domus terrace gardens reception rooms mural paintings (visual works) candelabras (candleholders)  House Description In its first phase, the house formed an L around a trapezoidal courtyard [1] (about 23 x 22 m) that was certainly developed as a garden. On the north and east it was bordered by a portico [2] with pilasters of which the foundation blocks remain. The portico (3.5 m wide) was bordered by two rectangular pools (each about 6.7 x 2.5 m) made of concrete with walls coated with cement. They drained to a collector. To the west of the courtyard is a circular well 4 meters deep lined with dressed hard limestone and without a puteal. It is not certain that it comes from Roman times.
The north wing of the house had six domestic rooms with concrete floors. The east side had the grand rooms decorated with mosaics and yielding fragments of wall painting, of marble, and of sculptural debris including a statuette and two marble hands belonging to feminine statues of life size. Further east opened a second garden [16], 10 meters wide and abutting the rampart.
Around the year 70, the house was extended to the south. In this Phase 2 form, it was the largest house as yet uncovered in the city. The excavated useful covered surface is 850 square meters, but it is estimated that the entire parcel was about 2847 square meters. It was on two levels; the new level to the south was about a meter below the original level. On its south side, the house was bordered by a domus not yet excavated, and perhaps the rampart was its northeast limit. It was accessed by a dead-end street running east-west and opening, it would seem, onto the cardo maximus. In this second phase, the house was occupied for two centuries.
Four groups of structures lay in a somewhat staggered pattern. All opened onto gardens through porticoes. The original structure on the upper terrace retained its L form with the north-south arm of the L between two gardens, [1 and 16]. The new, lower terrace was roughly square with portico-bordered gardens in the northeast [27] and southwest [17] quadrants and structures in the other two quadrants. The south garden [17], known only in part, included a rectangular pool and 3-meter wide porticoes on at least the north and east sides. The columns had finely sculptured Corinthian capitals [18]. Among the residential rooms should be noted the vast salon [23] for reception of guests. To the east, two other large rooms, [29] and [30] (12 x 7 m) on the axis of the pool were certainly also used for reception. They had a white mosaic with black framing lines and also beautiful mural paintings of high quality. Panels of cinnabar red were set off by inter-panel areas in Egyptian blue with pictures of theatrical masks hung from candelabra.Plans   House under the Pasteur parking lot_phase1     House under the Pasteur parking lot_phase2   Dates Bibliography   R.

      <description>Province Africa proconsularis(Pleiades)
Province Description The history of Roman Africa begins in 146 BC with the destruction of Carthage and the establishment of the province of Africa in the most fertile part of the Carthaginian Empire. The new province covered about 5000 square miles (17,172 square kilometers) of the northern part of modern Tunisia. A praetor governed the area from his headquarters at Utica. The Romans inherited a thriving agriculture developed by the Carthaginians. The climate was hospitable. Wheat and barley were the most important cereals; wine and olive oil were also produced and there were various fruit trees.
Location ALTHIBUROS (Médeïna) Tunisia(Pleiades)
Location Description This town is located on the road between Carthage and Theveste near the border of Proconsularis and Byzacena 35 km west of Mactar. Under the Roman Empire it remained an indigenous civitas until it was raised to the status of a municipium by Hadrian: municipium aelium hadrianum augustum althiburitanum and later was granted the ius Italicum.
The trade of agricultural products and craftsmanship made Althiburos a prosperous city, particularly, the fabrication and the commerce of aromatics. The development of the city reached its peak under the Antonian and Severian dynasties. It is difficult to follow the history of Althiburos during the third century when the province of Africa underwent the severe crisis of 238. The city was abandoned just before the Arab conquest. Excavations have brought to light the forum, the capitol, the Hadrianic triumphal arch and two temples. At the east corner of the forum, near one of the temples, was a complex of houses and a building with a rotonda to the south of which stood a monumental fountain. Outside the excavated center are other monuments, among them the theater and a triumphal arch.
Garden House of the Fishing Scene (Maison de la scène de pêche)
Keywords  peristyles (colonnades)  Garden Description The house stands on the other side of the Wadi Oum El Abid, on the left bank, 120 meters to the north of the capitol. The badly damaged rooms are arranged around a peristyle whose porticoes are paved with mosaics (Plan view, Fig.1). A long basin bisected the garden that was enclosed by a balustrade running in between the columns. One of the rooms to the north of the peristyle has two symmetrical apses at each end and is paved with a famous mosaic representing a fishing scene with the head of Oceanus depicted at either end.

The center was no doubt a garden. A vast reception room [15], paved with an opus sectile, looked out onto the central axis of the garden. It was flanked by two other handsome rooms; the one to the west [18] also had a marble floor. An exedra [5] with an opus sectile floor opened in the center of the east wing over a wide threshold, embellished on each side by a pilaster and column. Room 14, also with a marble floor, is more withdrawn. The principal reception room opened onto another open space [1], thought to have been 22 meters long by 7 meters wide, delimited at ground level by a stone border. Perhaps treated as a garden, it was made pleasant by two stone basins with water jets placed on the axis of the rooms [18] and [16]. The view was rounded off by the large flattened semicircle of the back (north) wall of the garden.

It was uncovered in 1842 by earth movers. It has been only incompletely explored, but 980 square meters of surface are known. Originally, it was thought to have been a public building; but it was, in fact, a house. It shares a common wall with the House with the Semicircular Bay (NAR6.4). A decumanus runs along the north side, where the entry is presumed to have been. To judge from the style of the paved floors, the construction goes back to the first century, and it was occupied for at least a century. An earlier structure has been detected by probes. The known part is organized in three distinct, successive spaces on the same axis running to the south. The first space, [9], is probably a vestibule and was ornamented in its first third by a quadrangular fountain of which a square block topped by a water jet was found. Then comes the principal room [2] (11 x 7 m), embellished by a very luxurious, geometric polychrome opus sectile with cross-ruling bands forming squares with rotated squares inside them, all in violet, green, gray, and red marble. In the central square is inscribed a disk. This room opens onto a portico [1] (13.5 x 12 m) around a courtyard or garden with a rectangular pool (11.2 x 6.8 m). East of the principal room [2] is a space thought to have been a rectangular pool [6] (6.0 x 4.2 m) surrounded on two sides by a portico.

Its floor was covered by a white mosaic with black border. On its south side, a semicircular protrusion extended the room across the portico and out into the garden. “At about two thirds of the way from the northern to the southern wall, near the mosaic, the room is crossed by a chain of very hard calcareous stone which seems to have formed a sort of sanctuary or chancel in the part terminated by the rounded bay.” (Rouard, 1842). Beyond, to the south, a large square courtyard [4] (about 8.2 meters on a side) was presumably a garden. It must have been surrounded by a portico 1.7 meters wide; but only the floor, with a white mosaic bordered by the same very hard stone, was discovered.

      <description>Province Africa Proconsularis (Pleiades)
Province Description The history of Roman Africa begins in 146 BC with the destruction of Carthage and the establishment of the province of Africa in the most fertile part of the Carthaginian Empire. The new province covered about 5000 square miles (17,172 square kilometers) of the northern part of modern Tunisia. A praetor governed the area from his headquarters at Utica. The Romans inherited a thriving agriculture developed by the Carthaginians. The climate was hospitable. Wheat and barley were the most important cereals; wine and olive oil were also produced and there were various fruit trees.
Location THUGGA (Douga) Tunisia (Pleiades)
Location Description Annexed in 46 B.C., the Romanization of the city of Thugga that was probably a residence of the Numidian kings, was gradual but profound. It became Municipium Thuggense in 205, and was raised to the rank of a Colonia Licinia Septima Aurelia Alexandriana Thuggensesin in 261 under Gallien. Numerous buildings of this city overlooking the valley of the Ouadi Khaled, have been uncovered among them the Capitol dedicated to the Capitoline Triad in 166-67, the theater on the top of the plateau constructed under Antonius Pius, the Temple of Mercury, Fortune, Augustan Piety, Liber Pater, Concordia, Frugifer, Pluto, Saturn and the Temple of Caelestis which stands in the middle of a an olive grove. In the residential areas stands the Licinian Baths with their Palestrae and the Cyclops Baths and the Triumphal Arch of Septimus Severus set astride a street leading down the hill. Two building inscriptions (CIL VIII, 26606 and CIL VIII, 26607), dated to AD 166-169 mention a theater with a basilica, porticoes, and xystis.
Garden House of the Trifolium (Maison du Trifolium)
Keywords  portico balustrade [prophylactic] oecus [trifolium] basins  Garden Description This house is the largest excavated to-date at Thugga. It appears to date from the first half of the 3rd centur. The rooms on the ground floor were arranged around a large court, which was more than 5 m (Plan view, Fig. 1) lower than the street. A garden occupied the center of the court which is enclosed by a portico on its four sides, the columns of which, carved with plaster and connected by a balustrade ought to have supported a wooden frame. The porticos were paved with beautiful mosaics of which certain motifs are of prophylactic character. The 3 doors of the oecus open onto the W portico, in front of which between two pilasters was a semi-circular pool projecting into the garden. This basin was decorated with a mosaic representing fish today destroyed. The oecus opens on the N onto a large room in the form of a trifolium.

      <description>Province Hispania Tarraconensis
Tarraconensis(Pleiades)
Province Description In 236 BC, to offset Carthage&amp;rsquo;s loss of Sicily and Sardinia in the First Punic War, Hamilcar Barca led an expedition into Hispania to establish a colony there. Through force of arms and diplomacy, he spread Carthaginian influence as far north as Barcellona, which bears his name. In 230 BC, Hasdrubal, his son-in-law, established Qart Hadast that became Carthago Nova in Roman times and Cartagena today. After the death of Hasdrubal, Hannibal, Hamilcar&amp;rsquo;s oldest son, took command, attacked Saguntum, and in 218 set out for Italy leaving his younger brother, Hasdrubal, in command in Spain. Through the Alps, he descended into Italy and threatened Rome for fourteen years. Roman armies under the brothers Gnaeus and Publius Cornelius Scipio kept Hasdrubal in check and prevented his reinforcing Hannibal. They were both killed by the Carthaginians in 212. Two years later, another Publius Cornelius Scipio, the 25-year-old son of the late general of the same name, was sent to Spain. The next year, he captured New Carthage and, in 206 at the battle of Ilipa (about 15 km north of Savilla) destroyed most of the Carthaginians&amp;rsquo; numerically superior army and ended their hold on Spain. Scipio settled his wounded veterans nearby at a place he called Italica to remind them of their origins. Today, it is one of the best Roman archaeological sites in Italy. After a quick trip back to Rome, where he was elected consul, he returned to Spain and went on to attack Carthage itself. Hannibal was recalled to Africa, but Scipio annihilated his army in 202. Rome thus came into possession of the Mediterranean coast of Iberia.
If Rome was drawn into Hispania to keep the Carthaginians there from supporting Hannibal in Italy, it missed the opportunity offered by Hannibal&amp;rsquo;s defeat to get out of Spain honorably. Instead, in 197 BC it created two new Roman provinces, Hispania Citerior whose capital was Carthago Nova and Hispania Ulterior with Corduba as its capital. Soon after, Rome launched a long war to subjugate the Lusitani, Celtiberians on the west coast. During Sulla&amp;rsquo;s dictatorship, the Lusitani were again in revolt, this time under the able leadership of the Roman general Quintus Sertorius, who sought to create an independent, Roman-like state in Hispania. He established a senate and schools for the sons of the local nobility.
Augustus&amp;rsquo;s conquest of Hispania produced a new territorial division that replaced the earlier two-province organization of the region. Augustus divided the whole of the peninsula into three provinces: Hispania Citerior or Tarraconensis, with its capital Tarraco (Tarragona); Hispania Ulterior Baetica, with its capital Corduba (Córdoba); and Hispania Ulterior Lusitania, or Emerita Augusta, with its capital Mérida. The provinces, in turn, were subdivided in administrative legal units, or conventus. The western lands stayed part of the newly demarcated Lusitania, areas into which Romanization had hardly penetrated, in contrast to the other areas of the peninsula where the classical tradition had been incorporated quite early. This division lasted until late antiquity, when Tarraconensis was subdivided into three provinces: Tarraconensis, whose capital continued to be Tarraco (Tarragona), Carthaginiensis, with Carthago Nova (Catagena) as its capital, and Gallaecia, whose capital was Bracara Augusta (Braga, in northern Portugal).
The Mediterranean trio of wine, oil and cereals are the crops most frequently mentioned by all the classical authors when referring to the Iberian Peninsula. These were not the only plants cultivated here. Trogus Pompey, in his Universal History (44. 1-2), praises, as well as those products, the fertility of the soil itself, the benevolence of its climate, the opportune and abundant rains which enable all types of fruits to be gathered, thus supplying every need. He describes the linen and esparto grass as of the highest quality. Strabo recorded the tradition of irrigation as a common practice in pre-Roman agriculture (Strabo 3.2.5). This was continued by the Romans, as shown by the number of aqueducts, dams and small reservoirs still to be found on Spanish soil. Pliny, during his stay as procurator in Spain in the first century, gives more specific descriptions of the flora throughout his Natural History (Book XVI). Martial (Epigrams II) refers to myrtle, box and laurel, as common elements to be found in the garden of country houses in Spain.
It is not strange, therefore, that gardening, the work of the topiarius, was usual in Iberian houses, as this study shows. It was not, however, totally new to Spanish territory. Although there are no literary references to gardening in the Pre-Roman era, it must have been part of Iberian culture, as is proved in an unusual way in the northwest of the peninsula in the area under the influence of Greek culture from the city of Emporion (Ampurias or Empuriae). A Hellenic establishment there, Rhode (Rosas), in the third century BC minted drachmas with a rose as the emblem. There were sacred woods connected with the cities. Close to Augustas Emeritas was Lucus Feroniae. Dedicated to Augustus was Lucus Augusti, which gave rise to the present-day Lugo, in Galicia, and another Lucus existed in the environs of Gijón, the Lugo de Llanera (Blázquez, p. 24).
There has been little research on the gardens in the Roman settlements in Spain and Portugal. In drawing up the list of sites with gardens for this catalog, we have accepted that a garden existed when it was so labeled by the excavators. There are, however, many other probable gardens which we have included. Gorges found just under forty villas where enough remained to draw a plan. In them, certain features help to identify a garden. A peristyle alerts us to suspect a garden, but peristyle courtyards were sometimes paved with stones or bricks over a layer of lime. They were clearly not gardens. But if the courtyard had soil in it, it was in all probability a garden. Fountains, fountain statues, and pools are typical of a garden since water is indispensable for a garden. Most peristyles in Roman villas in Spain had ornamental irrigation channels, semicircular pools, wells or pools that gave the impression of still water that, nevertheless, endowed the garden with a cool humidity that favored the cultivation of plants. In Spain, peristyles with drainage are found in the first and second centuries AD and are also common in the late Empire. Certain types of statuary intimately connected with vegetation and nature are found in gardens, such as divinities related to Bacchus and his circle. At Pompeii, Diana, a garden goddess, sometimes paired with Apollo, is also found. Herms were placed on pilasters, as the examples in situ from Pompeii show. Characteristic of Roman villas was the way in which they opened out to the countryside onto a grand vista of gardens and parks filled with fountains.
The roughly triangular province of Tarraconensis, by far the largest of the three provinces of the Iberian Peninsula, stretched across the north side of modern Spain and down the east coast as far as Almeria. On the Atlantic coast, it reached as far south as present Oporto.

  Location Clunia
Clunia (Pleiades)
Location Description This settlement, dating from Julio-Claudian times, is on a high meseta some 60 meters above the surrounding plain and a hundred meters above the water in the Arandilla River. (The Celtoiberian settlement of Clunia, mentioned in the second century BC, seems to have been a short distance away on the other side of the Arandilla.) Clunia was made a Municipium in the reign of Tiberius, and later became a colony, Colonia Clunia Sulpicia. Beginning in the reign of Claudius and throughout the rest of the first and second centuries, it was the administrative capital of Hispania Tarraconensis. At this time, it was probably the largest Roman city in Iberia. The third century saw a decline and loss of the role of administrative center; there was a revival in the fourth century lasting to at least the middle of the fifth century, but it stopped short of a return to former prosperity. Depopulation followed in the sixth and seventh centuries, and the residents used the area as a necropolis.
It was identified as a Roman site by scholars in the 16th century. A plan published in 1788 shows that streets, squares, and walls were then still visible, but subsequent quarrying for stone destroyed the remains. Systematic excavations began in 1915-1916 and continued under the direction of Blas Taracena for several years following 1931 (when it was declared a national monument). After the interruption caused by the Spanish civil war, work was resumed in 1958 under the direction of Pedro de Palol.
The steep sides of the meseta and its height above the surrounding plain clearly made the site defensible, but at the same time posed a problem of water supply, especially for the gardens and extensive baths. Aqueducts were out of the question; elevated spans nearly twice the height of the Pont du Gard and many kilometers long would have been necessary. The solution lay in a series of natural caverns in the limestone which the Romans connected and dammed up with locks at the outlet at the northern end. These structures turned the whole meseta into a catch basin for water during the rainy season. They held some 1.5 million liters. The water level was about 15 meters below the ground level at the baths and about 20 meters below at House 1. Such a depth meant that it was worthwhile to catch water in cisterns near the surface, but the bottoms of some 15 conical wells into the caverns leave no doubt that the water was used in dry periods. The structures were identified in 1913 by Vicente Hinojal; further explored in 1976 and 1977 by Pedro de Palol; and then thoroughly explored and mapped beginning in 1981 by archaeologists in collaboration with the local speleological group. Further geophysical study was underway in 2004.

  Garden Arcos I Public Baths
Keywords  natationes caldaria  Garden Description These baths are remarkable for their size (55 x 95 m), symmetry, and inclusion of a large garden. At the back of the grand semicircular entrance hall opened the garden, formerly thought to have been a natatio. On either side then followed a palestra (Fig. 1, P), an apodyterium or changing room (A), a frigidarium (F), and a tepidarium (T). Only the caldarium (C) was shared between the sexes. The semicircular wall at the northeastern end of the garden area goes quite deep into the ground and was presumably part of a swimming pool. As late as 1994, de Palol thought that most of the central court had been a pool, but subsequent thorough investigation could not find evidence for it except near that wall. The oldest elements go back to Tiberian times as attested by ceramics near the base of the semicircular wall, constituting the oldest finds in Clunia. Two further datable extensions occurred in Flavian and Antonine times.

      <description>Province Asia Asia (Pleiades)
Province description The region of what is now modern Turkey became a part of the Roman Empire in 133 B.C. when king Attalos III of Pergamum bequeathed his kingdom to the Roman people. The province included the heartland of the Pergamene kingdom as well as the territories of Mysia, Lydia, Ionia, Caria, western Phrygia and the eastern Aegean islands. Under Augustus in 27 B.C. Asia was declared a senatorial province and the governance of a proconsul. The capital of the province was Ephesos, although Pergamon may have fulfilled this role initially. Under Diocletian (284-305 A.D.) the province was subdivided into smaller administrative units: Hellespontus, Asia, Lydia, Caria, Phrygia I and Phrygia II. Due to its excellent harbors on the west coast and its many navigable rivers, Asia’s water-borne trade with the rest of the Mediterranean flourished. In the second century A.D. Asia experienced great prosperity, to which the growth and architectural aggrandizement of many of its cities attest. In the area of Kibyra, bordering the regions of Lycia, Caria, Phrygia and Pisidia, numerous inscriptions refer to the large imperial estates of Roman families. Woolen textiles, marble, and timber constituted a significant part of the commodities exported from the province.
While the Romans might have looked to the Greeks for inspiration in philosophy, architecture, sculpture, and the fine arts, the non-Greek peoples of the eastern Mediterranean are their inspiration for luxury, fine-living, and the status conferred by displays of individual wealth (Athenaeus Deip. XV.690). Asia was a center for such splendor, first in the kingdoms of Lydia, Phrygia, and Lycia, and then continued by the Persian satraps, and later the Hellenistic kings. The Persian paradeisos is particularly well-attested in literature referencing Asia. That these gardens are known primarily from Roman-period literary sources indicates their continuing influence. For example, long after the gold of Lydia’s Pactolus River had disappeared, Lydia remained a literary topos, not only for copious wealth, but for a life of luxury set in a landscape of natural abundance. Athenaeus (Deipnosophistae 12.515d-f) wrote in the second century A.D. that
&amp;ldquo;The Lydians in their luxury planned parks and made them like gardens and so kept in the shade. For they thought it more dainty not to have the sun’s rays touch them at all…&amp;rdquo;
Other districts of Asia captured the Roman imagination: Pliny the Elder writes of an ancient plane tree (Sycamorus orientalis) in Lycia with a girth of sufficient circumference to house a grotto in its hollow trunk, ornamented with pumice and moss with provisions for 18 people to dine there (Pliny HN 12.9).
The paradeisoi of the Persian satraps are of particular influence on the introduction of horti and gardens of Rome. The paradeisos, from the Persian, paira daeza, or “enclosed place,” is a term that had evolved by the Hellenistic period to mean a large enclosed park with luxurious gardens as well as orchards, collections of trees, crops, and hunting areas (see Sardis below). It was at Sardis that the Greek Lysander visited Cyrus the Younger, a visit recorded by Clearchus and retold by Xenophon. It is an essential moment in garden history recounted for the Romans by Cicero, De Senectute. 17.59. These paradeisoi, in the sense of luxurious orchards, are said by the Romans to have been brought to Greece by Kimon (Aristot. apud Plut. Cim. 10; comp. Cic. de Off. 2.18Plutarch), and were adopted by Hellenistic kings throughout Greece and southern Italy during the late Hellenistic period. The hunting parks at Daskyleion and Celenae are also vividly described by Xenophon (See Anabasis 1.2.7, 2.4.14 and Oeconomicus 4.13). Xenophon also describes how paradeisoi were occupied or cut down by armies during the fourth and third centuries BC. Appreciation for these parks apparently continued, and Seleucus of Syria took over the royal paradeisos at Sardis (Plutarch, Demetrios 50.6). Years of instability followed, so it is difficult to know what the Romans themselves thought of paradeisoi in Asia in the second and first centuries B.C. Notable examples of paradeisoi, in some form, may have been visible to Romans visiting Asia, as well. For example, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus is now thought by its excavators to have been set in a grove or park.
Thus, the paradeisos, the alsos, the gymnasium, and the quadriporticus are not forms the Romans suddenly “discovered.” They had had a long influence and were integrated into the Hellenistic architectural forms of the Italic landscape. In the second century B.C., however, when the Roman generals began to define themselves as rulers of an empire, they turned directly to the palaces and paradeisoi of the Hellenistic monarchs to establish their power, to display spoils of war, and to create the luxurious setting for life in Rome. They further adapted the evolving quadriporticus form for display to the public Despite the importance of Asia Minor in the history of the Roman landscape, archaeological evidence is scant. The excavators contacted for this essay indicated that parks, gardens, and other planted areas have yet to become a subject of research design for the region and finds appear to be few—primarily inscriptions and wall paintings. Most of the smaller domestic courtyards—often the most manageable to investigate - are paved. The larger palaestrae, gymnasia, and enclosed open spaces have not been investigated for landscape architectural and planting features, although recently an important campaign of work in the South Agora at Aphrodisias is setting an important precedent (see below). This catalog includes areas with dirt and incomplete paved surfaces, and notes sites where the excavators have some level of optimism about fruitful future study. The subject of designed landscapes, gardens, and planted areas in Asia Minor awaits archaeological investigation.
Location EPHESOS (Efes, Turkey) (Pleiades)
Location Description Remains of gardens have yet to be discovered in this city, but an appreciation for garden culture is seen in the Terrace Houses, dating to the second and third centuries A.D., where wall paintings not only depict gardens, but use garden images to create the illustionistic experience of being in the space of garden.
House Terrace House 2
Keywords  courtyard dado peristyle (Roman courtyards) medallion (ornament areas) putto  House Description The most striking remains are in Terrace House 2, in Room 20 (Residence 4), excavated by H. Vetters between 1967-1983. Here, in a space originally designed as a courtyard, the walls are decorated with an elaborate garden scene. Much of the painting is covered by a later painting of marble panels, but on the north and west walls the garden scene has been partially revealed (Figs. 1 and 2). The viewer within the room looks out past a real marble dado on top of which is an illusionistic marble fence with an unusual egg and dart design along the top. Beyond is a garden scene, similar to those seen in Pompeii or the famous garden scene of Livia at Prima Porta. The scene is filled with luxuriant foliage, out of which apple trees rise up against the blue sky bearing apples or quinces. A bird flies over a young juniper or cypress. The illusion of the garden continues without a break around the corners. It allows the viewers to feel present in a garden, while knowing they are in a room looking out at it. The later painting completely destroys both the illusion and any recollection that the space had formerly been an open courtyard.
In the central peristyle of Residence 2 of Terrace House 2, Vetters uncovered a late Imperial mosaic of Dionysius and Ariadne in a niche. The peristyle itself is a paved courtyard, but the mosaic offers the viewer a rich view of a paradisiacal vineyard. A lunette features a mosaic of two peacocks holding a garland over a basket or urn of grapes and fruits, with white geese to each side standing on a green lawn with roses and lilies (Fig. 3). The ceiling of the niche features Dionysias and Ariadne in a central medallion set into a panel of blue, against which is arrayed a vine laden with grapes and doves (Fig. 4). In the upper corner, the vine emerges from the ground, and along the base of the wall, a winged putto leads two harnessed leopards or panthers. The opposite side is not preserved.
Just off the peristyle in Room 17, the walls feature a variety of birds, individually portrayed on white backgrounds either sitting on branches or standing among small plants. In Room 24, the landscape themes continue with a painting of stags in woodland, apparently being chased by a putto. Only a small fragment remains. In Room 14, mythological scenes of Achilles and Skyros (west wall) and Achilles and Priam (south wall) are set in a landscape of rocks and trees (Fig. 6). Bird and plant themes are represented through this house.

      <description>Province Asia
Asia (Pleiades)
Province description The region of what is now modern Turkey became a part of the Roman Empire in 133 B.C. when king Attalos III of Pergamum bequeathed his kingdom to the Roman people. The province included the heartland of the Pergamene kingdom as well as the territories of Mysia, Lydia, Ionia, Caria, western Phrygia and the eastern Aegean islands. Under Augustus in 27 B.C. Asia was declared a senatorial province and the governance of a proconsul. The capital of the province was Ephesos, although Pergamon may have fulfilled this role initially. Under Diocletian (284-305 A.D.) the province was subdivided into smaller administrative units: Hellespontus, Asia, Lydia, Caria, Phrygia I and Phrygia II. Due to its excellent harbors on the west coast and its many navigable rivers, Asia’s water-borne trade with the rest of the Mediterranean flourished. In the second century A.D. Asia experienced great prosperity, to which the growth and architectural aggrandizement of many of its cities attest. In the area of Kibyra, bordering the regions of Lycia, Caria, Phrygia and Pisidia, numerous inscriptions refer to the large imperial estates of Roman families. Woolen textiles, marble, and timber constituted a significant part of the commodities exported from the province.
While the Romans might have looked to the Greeks for inspiration in philosophy, architecture, sculpture, and the fine arts, the non-Greek peoples of the eastern Mediterranean are their inspiration for luxury, fine-living, and the status conferred by displays of individual wealth (Athenaeus Deip. XV.690). Asia was a center for such splendor, first in the kingdoms of Lydia, Phrygia, and Lycia, and then continued by the Persian satraps, and later the Hellenistic kings. The Persian paradeisos is particularly well-attested in literature referencing Asia. That these gardens are known primarily from Roman-period literary sources indicates their continuing influence. For example, long after the gold of Lydia’s Pactolus River had disappeared, Lydia remained a literary topos, not only for copious wealth, but for a life of luxury set in a landscape of natural abundance. Athenaeus (Deipnosophistae 12.515d-f) wrote in the second century A.D. that
&amp;ldquo;The Lydians in their luxury planned parks and made them like gardens and so kept in the shade. For they thought it more dainty not to have the sun’s rays touch them at all…&amp;rdquo;
Other districts of Asia captured the Roman imagination: Pliny the Elder writes of an ancient plane tree (Sycamorus orientalis) in Lycia with a girth of sufficient circumference to house a grotto in its hollow trunk, ornamented with pumice and moss with provisions for 18 people to dine there (Pliny HN 12.9).
The paradeisoi of the Persian satraps are of particular influence on the introduction of horti and gardens of Rome. The paradeisos, from the Persian, paira daeza, or “enclosed place,” is a term that had evolved by the Hellenistic period to mean a large enclosed park with luxurious gardens as well as orchards, collections of trees, crops, and hunting areas (see Sardis below). It was at Sardis that the Greek Lysander visited Cyrus the Younger, a visit recorded by Clearchus and retold by Xenophon. It is an essential moment in garden history recounted for the Romans by Cicero, De Senectute. 17.59. These paradeisoi, in the sense of luxurious orchards, are said by the Romans to have been brought to Greece by Kimon (Aristot. apud Plut. Cim. 10; comp. Cic. de Off. 2.18Plutarch), and were adopted by Hellenistic kings throughout Greece and southern Italy during the late Hellenistic period. The hunting parks at Daskyleion and Celenae are also vividly described by Xenophon (See Anabasis 1.2.7, 2.4.14 and Oeconomicus 4.13). Xenophon also describes how paradeisoi were occupied or cut down by armies during the fourth and third centuries BC. Appreciation for these parks apparently continued, and Seleucus of Syria took over the royal paradeisos at Sardis (Plutarch, Demetrios 50.6). Years of instability followed, so it is difficult to know what the Romans themselves thought of paradeisoi in Asia in the second and first centuries B.C. Notable examples of paradeisoi, in some form, may have been visible to Romans visiting Asia, as well. For example, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus is now thought by its excavators to have been set in a grove or park.
Thus, the paradeisos, the alsos, the gymnasium, and the quadriporticus are not forms the Romans suddenly “discovered.” They had had a long influence and were integrated into the Hellenistic architectural forms of the Italic landscape. In the second century B.C., however, when the Roman generals began to define themselves as rulers of an empire, they turned directly to the palaces and paradeisoi of the Hellenistic monarchs to establish their power, to display spoils of war, and to create the luxurious setting for life in Rome. They further adapted the evolving quadriporticus form for display to the public Despite the importance of Asia Minor in the history of the Roman landscape, archaeological evidence is scant. The excavators contacted for this essay indicated that parks, gardens, and other planted areas have yet to become a subject of research design for the region and finds appear to be few—primarily inscriptions and wall paintings. Most of the smaller domestic courtyards—often the most manageable to investigate - are paved. The larger palaestrae, gymnasia, and enclosed open spaces have not been investigated for landscape architectural and planting features, although recently an important campaign of work in the South Agora at Aphrodisias is setting an important precedent (see below). This catalog includes areas with dirt and incomplete paved surfaces, and notes sites where the excavators have some level of optimism about fruitful future study. The subject of designed landscapes, gardens, and planted areas in Asia Minor awaits archaeological investigation.
Location EPHESOS (Efes, Turkey) (Pleiades)
Location Description Remains of gardens have yet to be discovered in this city, but an appreciation for garden culture is seen in the Terrace Houses, dating to the second and third centuries A.D., where wall paintings not only depict gardens, but use garden images to create the illustionistic experience of being in the space of garden.
Garden Tomb Garden and Orchard of Aphrodisios and Flavia
Keywords  stele sarcophagi (coffins) pvmãrin pomarium tomb monuments  Garden Description According to a secondary inscription carved horizontally, perhaps in the third century A.D., across the back of a figured grave stele of perhaps the third or second century B.C., found on the road between the Magnesia gate and the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, “this orchard with its sarcophagi and pavilion (?yÒlow) belongs to Aphrodisios and his wife and children” (toËto tÚ pvmãrin §st‹n sÁn tew svro›w k¢ t“ yÒlƒ ÉAfrodis¤ou k¢ g(u)n(aikÚw) Flab€aw k¢ t°knv[n]). The first editor, Hicks, interpreted the word pvmãrin to mean “cover” or “lid” (p«ma) and thought that the stele originally protected the entrance to the monument, but Keil (who corrected the misreading §vro›wto svro›w[for soro›w], “sarcophagi”), rightly saw that pvmãrin was nothing more than a transliterated form of the Latin pomarium, fruit orchard, an amenity often attached to tomb monuments in the Roman world. The character of the yÒlow is uncertain—the term is attested only once elsewhere in Asia Minor in a funerary context, in Pisidia, where a yÒlow is equipped with statues (Monumenta Asiae Minoris Antiquae. Manchester and London, 1928-1993, VIII, 375; cf. Kubin’ska)—but the transliterated pumarin gives reason to suspect that a Roman context is here relevant, in which case one naturally thinks of the sort of ornamental (often round) pavilion (diaeta) frequently found in Roman tomb gardens.

A silver bust, supposedly of the emperor Galba, found in the street in front of this house gave the site its name. Twelve stuccoed tuffa columns support a portico which encloses this peristyle garden. A marble faced cruciform basin in the center contained a small column with a fountain. The columns were connected by a low wall with an entrance on the east opposite the exedra providing a view of the garden and fountain.

Keywords  shrine fountains trellises  Garden Description The Palaestra was crossed by Burbon tunnels in 1756-1760 and partially excavated from 1933 to 1954. Carbonized remains of large tree trunks found in the southwest corner and along the north side against the portico where they were swept by the volcanic flow indicated to Maiuri that the central area had been planted with trees similar to the central area of the Great Palestra at Pompeii. The soil was compacted, as typical of athletic fields, and no evidence of paths or beds have yet been found. A large cruciform pool occupied the center of the area. The north-south arm is 55.00 m. long, the east-west arm is 31.50 m. long, each arm is 5.80 wide and the depth is 1.00-1.10 m. at the center. A masonry base 0.95 m. square and 1.14 m. high stood at the center of the intersection and presumably held the monumental bronze fountain sculpture found in 1952 at the bottom of the pool. The statue is a five-headed serpent 2.45 m. high coiled around a tree with water jetting from the mouth of each head. On the west end of the pool there is a pilaster with a smaller jet. Two meters from the front of the enclosed portico on the north side there is a rectangular pool 3.00 x 30.00 m.; 2.35 m. deep which was proportioned the same as a swimming pool, but had been abandoned before the eruption. Close to the bottom of the pool thirty five amphoras were installed in the walls, with openings ranging from 20 to 30 cm. in diameter. These provided shelter and spawning areas for fish.

Keywords  parapets podium shrine woven rim trellises  Garden Description The southern edge of town was against a sharp drop to the sea. A terrace located on this drop held two shrines (a) and (b) and a series of rooms for cult activities. All of these faced on a long garden (c) 6.85 x 22.60 m. where the fragments of two large marble fountain basins were found when this area was excavated in 1939 to 1958. On the south end of the garden a parapet had a podium which could have been used as a garden seat. Garden paintings decorated the interior walls of shrine (b). The fragments that survived were enough to give an idea of what the original effect must have been. The lower part of the panel to the left of the entrance on the south is the best preserved. The base of the wall was painted with hart’s-tongue ferns, each plant separated by a trellis that was identical to the woven fence just above which must have encircled the entire room. A garden extended behind the fence and on the south wall a marble basin supported by three legs was graced by three doves perched on the rim to drink. A small date palm and flowers are nearby, including a corn poppy on the left with carefully executed foliage and flowers, two in profile and the others drawn open faced. A young palm tree and a plant with daisy-like flowers comes next and to the right of the basin there is a rosebush with blossoms very similar to the ones painted in the garden rooms of I.ix.5. The east wall appears to have had a crater-shaped fountain, and on the north wall above the large podium altar three panels each contained a garden painting. The side panels each had a young palm tree as the dominant feature in the middle, but the center panel was too damaged to determine what it contained.

      <description>Province Hispania Tarraconensis
Tarraconensis(Pleiades)
Province Description In 236 BC, to offset Carthage&amp;rsquo;s loss of Sicily and Sardinia in the First Punic War, Hamilcar Barca led an expedition into Hispania to establish a colony there. Through force of arms and diplomacy, he spread Carthaginian influence as far north as Barcellona, which bears his name. In 230 BC, Hasdrubal, his son-in-law, established Qart Hadast that became Carthago Nova in Roman times and Cartagena today. After the death of Hasdrubal, Hannibal, Hamilcar&amp;rsquo;s oldest son, took command, attacked Saguntum, and in 218 set out for Italy leaving his younger brother, Hasdrubal, in command in Spain. Through the Alps, he descended into Italy and threatened Rome for fourteen years. Roman armies under the brothers Gnaeus and Publius Cornelius Scipio kept Hasdrubal in check and prevented his reinforcing Hannibal. They were both killed by the Carthaginians in 212. Two years later, another Publius Cornelius Scipio, the 25-year-old son of the late general of the same name, was sent to Spain. The next year, he captured New Carthage and, in 206 at the battle of Ilipa (about 15 km north of Savilla) destroyed most of the Carthaginians&amp;rsquo; numerically superior army and ended their hold on Spain. Scipio settled his wounded veterans nearby at a place he called Italica to remind them of their origins. Today, it is one of the best Roman archaeological sites in Italy. After a quick trip back to Rome, where he was elected consul, he returned to Spain and went on to attack Carthage itself. Hannibal was recalled to Africa, but Scipio annihilated his army in 202. Rome thus came into possession of the Mediterranean coast of Iberia.
If Rome was drawn into Hispania to keep the Carthaginians there from supporting Hannibal in Italy, it missed the opportunity offered by Hannibal&amp;rsquo;s defeat to get out of Spain honorably. Instead, in 197 BC it created two new Roman provinces, Hispania Citerior whose capital was Carthago Nova and Hispania Ulterior with Corduba as its capital. Soon after, Rome launched a long war to subjugate the Lusitani, Celtiberians on the west coast. During Sulla&amp;rsquo;s dictatorship, the Lusitani were again in revolt, this time under the able leadership of the Roman general Quintus Sertorius, who sought to create an independent, Roman-like state in Hispania. He established a senate and schools for the sons of the local nobility.
Augustus&amp;rsquo;s conquest of Hispania produced a new territorial division that replaced the earlier two-province organization of the region. Augustus divided the whole of the peninsula into three provinces: Hispania Citerior or Tarraconensis, with its capital Tarraco (Tarragona); Hispania Ulterior Baetica, with its capital Corduba (Córdoba); and Hispania Ulterior Lusitania, or Emerita Augusta, with its capital Mérida. The provinces, in turn, were subdivided in administrative legal units, or conventus. The western lands stayed part of the newly demarcated Lusitania, areas into which Romanization had hardly penetrated, in contrast to the other areas of the peninsula where the classical tradition had been incorporated quite early. This division lasted until late antiquity, when Tarraconensis was subdivided into three provinces: Tarraconensis, whose capital continued to be Tarraco (Tarragona), Carthaginiensis, with Carthago Nova (Catagena) as its capital, and Gallaecia, whose capital was Bracara Augusta (Braga, in northern Portugal).
The Mediterranean trio of wine, oil and cereals are the crops most frequently mentioned by all the classical authors when referring to the Iberian Peninsula. These were not the only plants cultivated here. Trogus Pompey, in his Universal History (44. 1-2), praises, as well as those products, the fertility of the soil itself, the benevolence of its climate, the opportune and abundant rains which enable all types of fruits to be gathered, thus supplying every need. He describes the linen and esparto grass as of the highest quality. Strabo recorded the tradition of irrigation as a common practice in pre-Roman agriculture (Strabo 3.2.5). This was continued by the Romans, as shown by the number of aqueducts, dams and small reservoirs still to be found on Spanish soil. Pliny, during his stay as procurator in Spain in the first century, gives more specific descriptions of the flora throughout his Natural History (Book XVI). Martial (Epigrams II) refers to myrtle, box and laurel, as common elements to be found in the garden of country houses in Spain.
It is not strange, therefore, that gardening, the work of the topiarius, was usual in Iberian houses, as this study shows. It was not, however, totally new to Spanish territory. Although there are no literary references to gardening in the Pre-Roman era, it must have been part of Iberian culture, as is proved in an unusual way in the northwest of the peninsula in the area under the influence of Greek culture from the city of Emporion (Ampurias or Empuriae). A Hellenic establishment there, Rhode (Rosas), in the third century BC minted drachmas with a rose as the emblem. There were sacred woods connected with the cities. Close to Augustas Emeritas was Lucus Feroniae. Dedicated to Augustus was Lucus Augusti, which gave rise to the present-day Lugo, in Galicia, and another Lucus existed in the environs of Gijón, the Lugo de Llanera (Blázquez, p. 24).
There has been little research on the gardens in the Roman settlements in Spain and Portugal. In drawing up the list of sites with gardens for this catalog, we have accepted that a garden existed when it was so labeled by the excavators. There are, however, many other probable gardens which we have included. Gorges found just under forty villas where enough remained to draw a plan. In them, certain features help to identify a garden. A peristyle alerts us to suspect a garden, but peristyle courtyards were sometimes paved with stones or bricks over a layer of lime. They were clearly not gardens. But if the courtyard had soil in it, it was in all probability a garden. Fountains, fountain statues, and pools are typical of a garden since water is indispensable for a garden. Most peristyles in Roman villas in Spain had ornamental irrigation channels, semicircular pools, wells or pools that gave the impression of still water that, nevertheless, endowed the garden with a cool humidity that favored the cultivation of plants. In Spain, peristyles with drainage are found in the first and second centuries AD and are also common in the late Empire. Certain types of statuary intimately connected with vegetation and nature are found in gardens, such as divinities related to Bacchus and his circle. At Pompeii, Diana, a garden goddess, sometimes paired with Apollo, is also found. Herms were placed on pilasters, as the examples in situ from Pompeii show. Characteristic of Roman villas was the way in which they opened out to the countryside onto a grand vista of gardens and parks filled with fountains.
The roughly triangular province of Tarraconensis, by far the largest of the three provinces of the Iberian Peninsula, stretched across the north side of modern Spain and down the east coast as far as Almeria. On the Atlantic coast, it reached as far south as present Oporto.

  Location Clunia
Clunia (Pleiades)
Location Description This settlement, dating from Julio-Claudian times, is on a high meseta some 60 meters above the surrounding plain and a hundred meters above the water in the Arandilla River. (The Celtoiberian settlement of Clunia, mentioned in the second century BC, seems to have been a short distance away on the other side of the Arandilla.) Clunia was made a Municipium in the reign of Tiberius, and later became a colony, Colonia Clunia Sulpicia. Beginning in the reign of Claudius and throughout the rest of the first and second centuries, it was the administrative capital of Hispania Tarraconensis. At this time, it was probably the largest Roman city in Iberia. The third century saw a decline and loss of the role of administrative center; there was a revival in the fourth century lasting to at least the middle of the fifth century, but it stopped short of a return to former prosperity. Depopulation followed in the sixth and seventh centuries, and the residents used the area as a necropolis.
It was identified as a Roman site by scholars in the 16th century. A plan published in 1788 shows that streets, squares, and walls were then still visible, but subsequent quarrying for stone destroyed the remains. Systematic excavations began in 1915-1916 and continued under the direction of Blas Taracena for several years following 1931 (when it was declared a national monument). After the interruption caused by the Spanish civil war, work was resumed in 1958 under the direction of Pedro de Palol.
The steep sides of the meseta and its height above the surrounding plain clearly made the site defensible, but at the same time posed a problem of water supply, especially for the gardens and extensive baths. Aqueducts were out of the question; elevated spans nearly twice the height of the Pont du Gard and many kilometers long would have been necessary. The solution lay in a series of natural caverns in the limestone which the Romans connected and dammed up with locks at the outlet at the northern end. These structures turned the whole meseta into a catch basin for water during the rainy season. They held some 1.5 million liters. The water level was about 15 meters below the ground level at the baths and about 20 meters below at House 1. Such a depth meant that it was worthwhile to catch water in cisterns near the surface, but the bottoms of some 15 conical wells into the caverns leave no doubt that the water was used in dry periods. The structures were identified in 1913 by Vicente Hinojal; further explored in 1976 and 1977 by Pedro de Palol; and then thoroughly explored and mapped beginning in 1981 by archaeologists in collaboration with the local speleological group. Further geophysical study was underway in 2004.

  Garden House of Taracena
Keywords  passages courtyards  Garden Description Excavated by Blas Taracena between 1933 and 1935, this house is located to the northeast of the forum. The arrangement of its gardens is most unusual. At the center of the house lies not a courtyard but an almost square summer triclinium with a stunning geometric mosaic. On the four sides were passageways and, beyond them small gardens, forming a Greek cross of gardens. Taracena was able to detect the soil contours of the planting beds of these gardens. (Fig 2), Although the gardens have not been replanted, the contours are now no longer visible.
In each courtyard was a cistern or well. The eastern courtyard had served as the atrium of the first phase of the house. Most of the wall paintings and mosaics in the house may date to the second half of the second century. The passageways in the north courtyard were paved in the reign of Constantine. The peristyle courtyard [53] at the rear of the complex (the north side) was probably a garden.
On the southeast corner of the house was a curious structure placed more than a meter below street level possibly to protect it from the harsh weather of the meseta . There are elements of a sort of subterranean peristyle and atrium with high walls between the columns. There are also kitchen fireplaces and connection to a cryptoportico.

      <description>Province Hispania Tarraconensis
Tarraconensis(Pleiades)
Province Description In 236 BC, to offset Carthage&amp;rsquo;s loss of Sicily and Sardinia in the First Punic War, Hamilcar Barca led an expedition into Hispania to establish a colony there. Through force of arms and diplomacy, he spread Carthaginian influence as far north as Barcellona, which bears his name. In 230 BC, Hasdrubal, his son-in-law, established Qart Hadast that became Carthago Nova in Roman times and Cartagena today. After the death of Hasdrubal, Hannibal, Hamilcar&amp;rsquo;s oldest son, took command, attacked Saguntum, and in 218 set out for Italy leaving his younger brother, Hasdrubal, in command in Spain. Through the Alps, he descended into Italy and threatened Rome for fourteen years. Roman armies under the brothers Gnaeus and Publius Cornelius Scipio kept Hasdrubal in check and prevented his reinforcing Hannibal. They were both killed by the Carthaginians in 212. Two years later, another Publius Cornelius Scipio, the 25-year-old son of the late general of the same name, was sent to Spain. The next year, he captured New Carthage and, in 206 at the battle of Ilipa (about 15 km north of Savilla) destroyed most of the Carthaginians&amp;rsquo; numerically superior army and ended their hold on Spain. Scipio settled his wounded veterans nearby at a place he called Italica to remind them of their origins. Today, it is one of the best Roman archaeological sites in Italy. After a quick trip back to Rome, where he was elected consul, he returned to Spain and went on to attack Carthage itself. Hannibal was recalled to Africa, but Scipio annihilated his army in 202. Rome thus came into possession of the Mediterranean coast of Iberia.
If Rome was drawn into Hispania to keep the Carthaginians there from supporting Hannibal in Italy, it missed the opportunity offered by Hannibal&amp;rsquo;s defeat to get out of Spain honorably. Instead, in 197 BC it created two new Roman provinces, Hispania Citerior whose capital was Carthago Nova and Hispania Ulterior with Corduba as its capital. Soon after, Rome launched a long war to subjugate the Lusitani, Celtiberians on the west coast. During Sulla&amp;rsquo;s dictatorship, the Lusitani were again in revolt, this time under the able leadership of the Roman general Quintus Sertorius, who sought to create an independent, Roman-like state in Hispania. He established a senate and schools for the sons of the local nobility.
Augustus&amp;rsquo;s conquest of Hispania produced a new territorial division that replaced the earlier two-province organization of the region. Augustus divided the whole of the peninsula into three provinces: Hispania Citerior or Tarraconensis, with its capital Tarraco (Tarragona); Hispania Ulterior Baetica, with its capital Corduba (Córdoba); and Hispania Ulterior Lusitania, or Emerita Augusta, with its capital Mérida. The provinces, in turn, were subdivided in administrative legal units, or conventus. The western lands stayed part of the newly demarcated Lusitania, areas into which Romanization had hardly penetrated, in contrast to the other areas of the peninsula where the classical tradition had been incorporated quite early. This division lasted until late antiquity, when Tarraconensis was subdivided into three provinces: Tarraconensis, whose capital continued to be Tarraco (Tarragona), Carthaginiensis, with Carthago Nova (Catagena) as its capital, and Gallaecia, whose capital was Bracara Augusta (Braga, in northern Portugal).
The Mediterranean trio of wine, oil and cereals are the crops most frequently mentioned by all the classical authors when referring to the Iberian Peninsula. These were not the only plants cultivated here. Trogus Pompey, in his Universal History (44. 1-2), praises, as well as those products, the fertility of the soil itself, the benevolence of its climate, the opportune and abundant rains which enable all types of fruits to be gathered, thus supplying every need. He describes the linen and esparto grass as of the highest quality. Strabo recorded the tradition of irrigation as a common practice in pre-Roman agriculture (Strabo 3.2.5). This was continued by the Romans, as shown by the number of aqueducts, dams and small reservoirs still to be found on Spanish soil. Pliny, during his stay as procurator in Spain in the first century, gives more specific descriptions of the flora throughout his Natural History (Book XVI). Martial (Epigrams II) refers to myrtle, box and laurel, as common elements to be found in the garden of country houses in Spain.
It is not strange, therefore, that gardening, the work of the topiarius, was usual in Iberian houses, as this study shows. It was not, however, totally new to Spanish territory. Although there are no literary references to gardening in the Pre-Roman era, it must have been part of Iberian culture, as is proved in an unusual way in the northwest of the peninsula in the area under the influence of Greek culture from the city of Emporion (Ampurias or Empuriae). A Hellenic establishment there, Rhode (Rosas), in the third century BC minted drachmas with a rose as the emblem. There were sacred woods connected with the cities. Close to Augustas Emeritas was Lucus Feroniae. Dedicated to Augustus was Lucus Augusti, which gave rise to the present-day Lugo, in Galicia, and another Lucus existed in the environs of Gijón, the Lugo de Llanera (Blázquez, p. 24).
There has been little research on the gardens in the Roman settlements in Spain and Portugal. In drawing up the list of sites with gardens for this catalog, we have accepted that a garden existed when it was so labeled by the excavators. There are, however, many other probable gardens which we have included. Gorges found just under forty villas where enough remained to draw a plan. In them, certain features help to identify a garden. A peristyle alerts us to suspect a garden, but peristyle courtyards were sometimes paved with stones or bricks over a layer of lime. They were clearly not gardens. But if the courtyard had soil in it, it was in all probability a garden. Fountains, fountain statues, and pools are typical of a garden since water is indispensable for a garden. Most peristyles in Roman villas in Spain had ornamental irrigation channels, semicircular pools, wells or pools that gave the impression of still water that, nevertheless, endowed the garden with a cool humidity that favored the cultivation of plants. In Spain, peristyles with drainage are found in the first and second centuries AD and are also common in the late Empire. Certain types of statuary intimately connected with vegetation and nature are found in gardens, such as divinities related to Bacchus and his circle. At Pompeii, Diana, a garden goddess, sometimes paired with Apollo, is also found. Herms were placed on pilasters, as the examples in situ from Pompeii show. Characteristic of Roman villas was the way in which they opened out to the countryside onto a grand vista of gardens and parks filled with fountains.
The roughly triangular province of Tarraconensis, by far the largest of the three provinces of the Iberian Peninsula, stretched across the north side of modern Spain and down the east coast as far as Almeria. On the Atlantic coast, it reached as far south as present Oporto.

  Location Emporiae
Emporiae (Pleiades)
Location Description As Strabo (3.4.8) tells us, Greeks from Phokaia, by way of Massalia (Marseilles), established a market town (Emporion) here. Archaeology gives a date of approximately 575- 550 BC. The original settlement was on an island in the mouth of the Fluvià River. About 550, the settlement began to spread south onto the mainland, and the original settlement became known as Palaiapolis, the Old City. For clarity, archaeologists have given this Greek settlement on the mainland the corresponding name of Neapolis, New City. The plural form of the Latin name for the area – Emporiae, “markets” – reflects the dual nature of the city. Though literary sources mention other Greek settlements along the coast of the Iberian Peninsula, this is the only one known archaeologically.
Not only was Emporion the point of first contact between the Celtoiberians and Hellenic civilization, it was also here that, in 218 B.C., Roman armies first entered Iberia. The Roman consul Publius Cornelius Scipio reached Massalia too late to intercept Hannibal on his march into Italy, so he dispatched his brother Cnaeus with part of his forces to Emporion to cut Hannibal&amp;rsquo;s supply lines, while he himself returned to engage the Carthaginian in the Po valley.
Neapolis was settled from north to south. The oldest parts date from before 550 BC. The oldest part of the city wall come from 450 – 425 BC. The Asklepion in the southwest corner was built in the 400 -350 BC period, as a reorganization of an older sanctuary. In the years 375 – 350 BC, a new wall extended farther south. The 2nd century BC saw major building programs. The wall was again extended southwards. A new agora was formed, and the Asklepion reorganized. Public baths were built in the northeastern part of the city about 100 BC. A Serapium was built in the southeastern corner in the first century B.C. Around 100 B.C., a Roman city surrounded by a wall (750 x 350 m) was built on a hill about 150 meters west of Neapolis where there had previously been a structure that was probably the Roman praesidium. We will refer to this area as the Roman City; it is also called the Republican City . Streets were laid out in a rectangular grid, and a large forum occupied the center of the southern half. Just outside the south wall were an amphitheater and a palaestra. Three large houses, two of them with gardens, have been found northeast of the forum and one to the southeast of it. The northern half of the city remains unexcavated. Once development of the Roman City began, Neapolis seems to have been little changed. The two walls between them were dismantled, but – rather strangely – replaced by a single wall, probably in connection with the creation of the Municipium Emporiae in about 36 – 27 B.C.
Neapolis was abandoned in the course of the second half of the first century AD. The Roman City seems to have ceased development at about that time but remained inhabited to nearly the end of the third century. This abandonment of a once-thriving trading town is probably connected with the silting up of the harbor. The mouth of the Fluvià River has shifted seven kilometers to the north, while Palaiapolis, once an island, is now a hill rising out of lowland where the harbor once was.
Publicly funded excavation of the northeastern part of Neapolis and the forum of the Roman City was conducted in 1846-8. Further systematic studies were conducted from 1908 to 1936 under E. Gandía, who took a great interest in stratigraphy before it was common to do so. The Spanish Civil War brought this work to an end, but Gandía&amp;rsquo;s day books have been preserved. Work was resumed in the 1940&amp;rsquo;s and 1950&amp;rsquo;s by M. Almagro, with recent work by R. Mar and J. Ruiz de Arbulo, and B. Tang. Tang emphasizes that it is often difficult or impossible to determine whether a space in a house in Neapolis was open or covered. The difficulty should not be so great in the case of gardens, for any sort of paving or hammered earth rules out the possibility of a garden. She identifies gardens in N5 and N7 and notes that also N 52 near the northern end of the western edge and N 75 on the northern edge “appear to have been provided with gardens or terraces.”

      <description>Province Hispania Tarraconensis
Tarraconensis(Pleiades)
Province Description In 236 BC, to offset Carthage&amp;rsquo;s loss of Sicily and Sardinia in the First Punic War, Hamilcar Barca led an expedition into Hispania to establish a colony there. Through force of arms and diplomacy, he spread Carthaginian influence as far north as Barcellona, which bears his name. In 230 BC, Hasdrubal, his son-in-law, established Qart Hadast that became Carthago Nova in Roman times and Cartagena today. After the death of Hasdrubal, Hannibal, Hamilcar&amp;rsquo;s oldest son, took command, attacked Saguntum, and in 218 set out for Italy leaving his younger brother, Hasdrubal, in command in Spain. Through the Alps, he descended into Italy and threatened Rome for fourteen years. Roman armies under the brothers Gnaeus and Publius Cornelius Scipio kept Hasdrubal in check and prevented his reinforcing Hannibal. They were both killed by the Carthaginians in 212. Two years later, another Publius Cornelius Scipio, the 25-year-old son of the late general of the same name, was sent to Spain. The next year, he captured New Carthage and, in 206 at the battle of Ilipa (about 15 km north of Savilla) destroyed most of the Carthaginians&amp;rsquo; numerically superior army and ended their hold on Spain. Scipio settled his wounded veterans nearby at a place he called Italica to remind them of their origins. Today, it is one of the best Roman archaeological sites in Italy. After a quick trip back to Rome, where he was elected consul, he returned to Spain and went on to attack Carthage itself. Hannibal was recalled to Africa, but Scipio annihilated his army in 202. Rome thus came into possession of the Mediterranean coast of Iberia.
If Rome was drawn into Hispania to keep the Carthaginians there from supporting Hannibal in Italy, it missed the opportunity offered by Hannibal&amp;rsquo;s defeat to get out of Spain honorably. Instead, in 197 BC it created two new Roman provinces, Hispania Citerior whose capital was Carthago Nova and Hispania Ulterior with Corduba as its capital. Soon after, Rome launched a long war to subjugate the Lusitani, Celtiberians on the west coast. During Sulla&amp;rsquo;s dictatorship, the Lusitani were again in revolt, this time under the able leadership of the Roman general Quintus Sertorius, who sought to create an independent, Roman-like state in Hispania. He established a senate and schools for the sons of the local nobility.
Augustus&amp;rsquo;s conquest of Hispania produced a new territorial division that replaced the earlier two-province organization of the region. Augustus divided the whole of the peninsula into three provinces: Hispania Citerior or Tarraconensis, with its capital Tarraco (Tarragona); Hispania Ulterior Baetica, with its capital Corduba (Córdoba); and Hispania Ulterior Lusitania, or Emerita Augusta, with its capital Mérida. The provinces, in turn, were subdivided in administrative legal units, or conventus. The western lands stayed part of the newly demarcated Lusitania, areas into which Romanization had hardly penetrated, in contrast to the other areas of the peninsula where the classical tradition had been incorporated quite early. This division lasted until late antiquity, when Tarraconensis was subdivided into three provinces: Tarraconensis, whose capital continued to be Tarraco (Tarragona), Carthaginiensis, with Carthago Nova (Catagena) as its capital, and Gallaecia, whose capital was Bracara Augusta (Braga, in northern Portugal).
The Mediterranean trio of wine, oil and cereals are the crops most frequently mentioned by all the classical authors when referring to the Iberian Peninsula. These were not the only plants cultivated here. Trogus Pompey, in his Universal History (44. 1-2), praises, as well as those products, the fertility of the soil itself, the benevolence of its climate, the opportune and abundant rains which enable all types of fruits to be gathered, thus supplying every need. He describes the linen and esparto grass as of the highest quality. Strabo recorded the tradition of irrigation as a common practice in pre-Roman agriculture (Strabo 3.2.5). This was continued by the Romans, as shown by the number of aqueducts, dams and small reservoirs still to be found on Spanish soil. Pliny, during his stay as procurator in Spain in the first century, gives more specific descriptions of the flora throughout his Natural History (Book XVI). Martial (Epigrams II) refers to myrtle, box and laurel, as common elements to be found in the garden of country houses in Spain.
It is not strange, therefore, that gardening, the work of the topiarius, was usual in Iberian houses, as this study shows. It was not, however, totally new to Spanish territory. Although there are no literary references to gardening in the Pre-Roman era, it must have been part of Iberian culture, as is proved in an unusual way in the northwest of the peninsula in the area under the influence of Greek culture from the city of Emporion (Ampurias or Empuriae). A Hellenic establishment there, Rhode (Rosas), in the third century BC minted drachmas with a rose as the emblem. There were sacred woods connected with the cities. Close to Augustas Emeritas was Lucus Feroniae. Dedicated to Augustus was Lucus Augusti, which gave rise to the present-day Lugo, in Galicia, and another Lucus existed in the environs of Gijón, the Lugo de Llanera (Blázquez, p. 24).
There has been little research on the gardens in the Roman settlements in Spain and Portugal. In drawing up the list of sites with gardens for this catalog, we have accepted that a garden existed when it was so labeled by the excavators. There are, however, many other probable gardens which we have included. Gorges found just under forty villas where enough remained to draw a plan. In them, certain features help to identify a garden. A peristyle alerts us to suspect a garden, but peristyle courtyards were sometimes paved with stones or bricks over a layer of lime. They were clearly not gardens. But if the courtyard had soil in it, it was in all probability a garden. Fountains, fountain statues, and pools are typical of a garden since water is indispensable for a garden. Most peristyles in Roman villas in Spain had ornamental irrigation channels, semicircular pools, wells or pools that gave the impression of still water that, nevertheless, endowed the garden with a cool humidity that favored the cultivation of plants. In Spain, peristyles with drainage are found in the first and second centuries AD and are also common in the late Empire. Certain types of statuary intimately connected with vegetation and nature are found in gardens, such as divinities related to Bacchus and his circle. At Pompeii, Diana, a garden goddess, sometimes paired with Apollo, is also found. Herms were placed on pilasters, as the examples in situ from Pompeii show. Characteristic of Roman villas was the way in which they opened out to the countryside onto a grand vista of gardens and parks filled with fountains.
The roughly triangular province of Tarraconensis, by far the largest of the three provinces of the Iberian Peninsula, stretched across the north side of modern Spain and down the east coast as far as Almeria. On the Atlantic coast, it reached as far south as present Oporto.

  Location Emporiae
Emporiae (Pleiades)
Location Description As Strabo (3.4.8) tells us, Greeks from Phokaia, by way of Massalia (Marseilles), established a market town (Emporion) here. Archaeology gives a date of approximately 575- 550 BC. The original settlement was on an island in the mouth of the Fluvià River. About 550, the settlement began to spread south onto the mainland, and the original settlement became known as Palaiapolis, the Old City. For clarity, archaeologists have given this Greek settlement on the mainland the corresponding name of Neapolis, New City. The plural form of the Latin name for the area – Emporiae, “markets” – reflects the dual nature of the city. Though literary sources mention other Greek settlements along the coast of the Iberian Peninsula, this is the only one known archaeologically.
Not only was Emporion the point of first contact between the Celtoiberians and Hellenic civilization, it was also here that, in 218 B.C., Roman armies first entered Iberia. The Roman consul Publius Cornelius Scipio reached Massalia too late to intercept Hannibal on his march into Italy, so he dispatched his brother Cnaeus with part of his forces to Emporion to cut Hannibal&amp;rsquo;s supply lines, while he himself returned to engage the Carthaginian in the Po valley.
Neapolis was settled from north to south. The oldest parts date from before 550 BC. The oldest part of the city wall come from 450 – 425 BC. The Asklepion in the southwest corner was built in the 400 -350 BC period, as a reorganization of an older sanctuary. In the years 375 – 350 BC, a new wall extended farther south. The 2nd century BC saw major building programs. The wall was again extended southwards. A new agora was formed, and the Asklepion reorganized. Public baths were built in the northeastern part of the city about 100 BC. A Serapium was built in the southeastern corner in the first century B.C. Around 100 B.C., a Roman city surrounded by a wall (750 x 350 m) was built on a hill about 150 meters west of Neapolis where there had previously been a structure that was probably the Roman praesidium. We will refer to this area as the Roman City; it is also called the Republican City . Streets were laid out in a rectangular grid, and a large forum occupied the center of the southern half. Just outside the south wall were an amphitheater and a palaestra. Three large houses, two of them with gardens, have been found northeast of the forum and one to the southeast of it. The northern half of the city remains unexcavated. Once development of the Roman City began, Neapolis seems to have been little changed. The two walls between them were dismantled, but – rather strangely – replaced by a single wall, probably in connection with the creation of the Municipium Emporiae in about 36 – 27 B.C.
Neapolis was abandoned in the course of the second half of the first century AD. The Roman City seems to have ceased development at about that time but remained inhabited to nearly the end of the third century. This abandonment of a once-thriving trading town is probably connected with the silting up of the harbor. The mouth of the Fluvià River has shifted seven kilometers to the north, while Palaiapolis, once an island, is now a hill rising out of lowland where the harbor once was.
Publicly funded excavation of the northeastern part of Neapolis and the forum of the Roman City was conducted in 1846-8. Further systematic studies were conducted from 1908 to 1936 under E. Gandía, who took a great interest in stratigraphy before it was common to do so. The Spanish Civil War brought this work to an end, but Gandía&amp;rsquo;s day books have been preserved. Work was resumed in the 1940&amp;rsquo;s and 1950&amp;rsquo;s by M. Almagro, with recent work by R. Mar and J. Ruiz de Arbulo, and B. Tang. Tang emphasizes that it is often difficult or impossible to determine whether a space in a house in Neapolis was open or covered. The difficulty should not be so great in the case of gardens, for any sort of paving or hammered earth rules out the possibility of a garden. She identifies gardens in N5 and N7 and notes that also N 52 near the northern end of the western edge and N 75 on the northern edge “appear to have been provided with gardens or terraces.”

Keywords  atriums porticoes  Garden Description House R2, situated south of House R1 in the area of the forum of the Roman City (Fig. 1), is of totally different design and is smaller, but equally luxurious. In describing the phases of its construction, we follow Tang&amp;rsquo;s account (page 126). (Fig. 2) In its first phase, from the first quarter of the 1st century BC, the area of House R2 was occupied by two separate, similar houses, designated R2A on the south and R2B on the north. Each had a single, central atrium, which opened onto the cardo along the west side. Behind each house, a hortus extended back and was bounded by an intervallum of the city wall. In the second phase, in the second third of the 1st century BC, house R2A expanded, absorbing its own hortus and that of its neighbor, and taking out part of the city wall and extending beyond it to the east. It also acquired the southeastern corner (room [15]) of its neighbor. The old hortus of R2A was replaced by a large garden of 400 square meters enclosed by a peristyle; and a suite of rooms, opening onto the garden, was added. on the east on land formerly outside the city wall. Moreover, a row of rooms [42 – 49] was built behind them and opening to the east. The area beyond them may have been a garden. In the the first century AD, in a third phase, the former hortus of House R2B was converted into a peristyle garden [35a] with porticoes on the east, south and west sides. Along the north side were three, precisely symmetric rooms. The south wall of the central one extended in an arc into the garden. This part of the wall probably had windows opening into the garden. Along the west side of the new peristyle garden a bath complex [30 – 32] was added. A fourth phase at the end of the 1st or beginning of the 2nd second century AD saw a reworking of the eastern side of the house, with a huge room [46] with a triple entrance from the wide portico which now ran along the east side. A large garden extended on to the east a distance not yet determined. The L-shaped portico next to the garden indicated an interest in protecting the garden from the north wind. A small altar with paintings of a serpent and cock was found in the house, possibly in the garden peristyle.

Keywords  atrium houses city walls  Garden Description These two adjacent houses are typical Tuscan atrium houses, both are against the western city wall, and both have gardens of some 50 square meters at the back of the house (Fig. 1). In Pompeii, Jashemski found many small, non-peristyle gardens in modest homes. Few have been found elsewhere, probably because they were in cities and most ancient cities are under modern ones. This example of two side-by-side is therefore particularly noteworthy. Mar and R. de Arbulo, in their comprehensive volume on Emporiae, give two somewhat different versions of House N5, one on page 366 and one on the foldout map in the pocket at the back of the book. The main differences, however, are in the interpretation of the walls and spaces on the inside of the house and do not affect the interpretation of the garden areas.

      <description>Province Hispania Tarraconensis
Tarraconensis(Pleiades)
Province Description In 236 BC, to offset Carthage&amp;rsquo;s loss of Sicily and Sardinia in the First Punic War, Hamilcar Barca led an expedition into Hispania to establish a colony there. Through force of arms and diplomacy, he spread Carthaginian influence as far north as Barcellona, which bears his name. In 230 BC, Hasdrubal, his son-in-law, established Qart Hadast that became Carthago Nova in Roman times and Cartagena today. After the death of Hasdrubal, Hannibal, Hamilcar&amp;rsquo;s oldest son, took command, attacked Saguntum, and in 218 set out for Italy leaving his younger brother, Hasdrubal, in command in Spain. Through the Alps, he descended into Italy and threatened Rome for fourteen years. Roman armies under the brothers Gnaeus and Publius Cornelius Scipio kept Hasdrubal in check and prevented his reinforcing Hannibal. They were both killed by the Carthaginians in 212. Two years later, another Publius Cornelius Scipio, the 25-year-old son of the late general of the same name, was sent to Spain. The next year, he captured New Carthage and, in 206 at the battle of Ilipa (about 15 km north of Savilla) destroyed most of the Carthaginians&amp;rsquo; numerically superior army and ended their hold on Spain. Scipio settled his wounded veterans nearby at a place he called Italica to remind them of their origins. Today, it is one of the best Roman archaeological sites in Italy. After a quick trip back to Rome, where he was elected consul, he returned to Spain and went on to attack Carthage itself. Hannibal was recalled to Africa, but Scipio annihilated his army in 202. Rome thus came into possession of the Mediterranean coast of Iberia.
If Rome was drawn into Hispania to keep the Carthaginians there from supporting Hannibal in Italy, it missed the opportunity offered by Hannibal&amp;rsquo;s defeat to get out of Spain honorably. Instead, in 197 BC it created two new Roman provinces, Hispania Citerior whose capital was Carthago Nova and Hispania Ulterior with Corduba as its capital. Soon after, Rome launched a long war to subjugate the Lusitani, Celtiberians on the west coast. During Sulla&amp;rsquo;s dictatorship, the Lusitani were again in revolt, this time under the able leadership of the Roman general Quintus Sertorius, who sought to create an independent, Roman-like state in Hispania. He established a senate and schools for the sons of the local nobility.
Augustus&amp;rsquo;s conquest of Hispania produced a new territorial division that replaced the earlier two-province organization of the region. Augustus divided the whole of the peninsula into three provinces: Hispania Citerior or Tarraconensis, with its capital Tarraco (Tarragona); Hispania Ulterior Baetica, with its capital Corduba (Córdoba); and Hispania Ulterior Lusitania, or Emerita Augusta, with its capital Mérida. The provinces, in turn, were subdivided in administrative legal units, or conventus. The western lands stayed part of the newly demarcated Lusitania, areas into which Romanization had hardly penetrated, in contrast to the other areas of the peninsula where the classical tradition had been incorporated quite early. This division lasted until late antiquity, when Tarraconensis was subdivided into three provinces: Tarraconensis, whose capital continued to be Tarraco (Tarragona), Carthaginiensis, with Carthago Nova (Catagena) as its capital, and Gallaecia, whose capital was Bracara Augusta (Braga, in northern Portugal).
The Mediterranean trio of wine, oil and cereals are the crops most frequently mentioned by all the classical authors when referring to the Iberian Peninsula. These were not the only plants cultivated here. Trogus Pompey, in his Universal History (44. 1-2), praises, as well as those products, the fertility of the soil itself, the benevolence of its climate, the opportune and abundant rains which enable all types of fruits to be gathered, thus supplying every need. He describes the linen and esparto grass as of the highest quality. Strabo recorded the tradition of irrigation as a common practice in pre-Roman agriculture (Strabo 3.2.5). This was continued by the Romans, as shown by the number of aqueducts, dams and small reservoirs still to be found on Spanish soil. Pliny, during his stay as procurator in Spain in the first century, gives more specific descriptions of the flora throughout his Natural History (Book XVI). Martial (Epigrams II) refers to myrtle, box and laurel, as common elements to be found in the garden of country houses in Spain.
It is not strange, therefore, that gardening, the work of the topiarius, was usual in Iberian houses, as this study shows. It was not, however, totally new to Spanish territory. Although there are no literary references to gardening in the Pre-Roman era, it must have been part of Iberian culture, as is proved in an unusual way in the northwest of the peninsula in the area under the influence of Greek culture from the city of Emporion (Ampurias or Empuriae). A Hellenic establishment there, Rhode (Rosas), in the third century BC minted drachmas with a rose as the emblem. There were sacred woods connected with the cities. Close to Augustas Emeritas was Lucus Feroniae. Dedicated to Augustus was Lucus Augusti, which gave rise to the present-day Lugo, in Galicia, and another Lucus existed in the environs of Gijón, the Lugo de Llanera (Blázquez, p. 24).
There has been little research on the gardens in the Roman settlements in Spain and Portugal. In drawing up the list of sites with gardens for this catalog, we have accepted that a garden existed when it was so labeled by the excavators. There are, however, many other probable gardens which we have included. Gorges found just under forty villas where enough remained to draw a plan. In them, certain features help to identify a garden. A peristyle alerts us to suspect a garden, but peristyle courtyards were sometimes paved with stones or bricks over a layer of lime. They were clearly not gardens. But if the courtyard had soil in it, it was in all probability a garden. Fountains, fountain statues, and pools are typical of a garden since water is indispensable for a garden. Most peristyles in Roman villas in Spain had ornamental irrigation channels, semicircular pools, wells or pools that gave the impression of still water that, nevertheless, endowed the garden with a cool humidity that favored the cultivation of plants. In Spain, peristyles with drainage are found in the first and second centuries AD and are also common in the late Empire. Certain types of statuary intimately connected with vegetation and nature are found in gardens, such as divinities related to Bacchus and his circle. At Pompeii, Diana, a garden goddess, sometimes paired with Apollo, is also found. Herms were placed on pilasters, as the examples in situ from Pompeii show. Characteristic of Roman villas was the way in which they opened out to the countryside onto a grand vista of gardens and parks filled with fountains.
The roughly triangular province of Tarraconensis, by far the largest of the three provinces of the Iberian Peninsula, stretched across the north side of modern Spain and down the east coast as far as Almeria. On the Atlantic coast, it reached as far south as present Oporto.

  Location Emporiae
Emporiae (Pleiades)
Location Description As Strabo (3.4.8) tells us, Greeks from Phokaia, by way of Massalia (Marseilles), established a market town (Emporion) here. Archaeology gives a date of approximately 575- 550 BC. The original settlement was on an island in the mouth of the Fluvià River. About 550, the settlement began to spread south onto the mainland, and the original settlement became known as Palaiapolis, the Old City. For clarity, archaeologists have given this Greek settlement on the mainland the corresponding name of Neapolis, New City. The plural form of the Latin name for the area – Emporiae, “markets” – reflects the dual nature of the city. Though literary sources mention other Greek settlements along the coast of the Iberian Peninsula, this is the only one known archaeologically.
Not only was Emporion the point of first contact between the Celtoiberians and Hellenic civilization, it was also here that, in 218 B.C., Roman armies first entered Iberia. The Roman consul Publius Cornelius Scipio reached Massalia too late to intercept Hannibal on his march into Italy, so he dispatched his brother Cnaeus with part of his forces to Emporion to cut Hannibal&amp;rsquo;s supply lines, while he himself returned to engage the Carthaginian in the Po valley.
Neapolis was settled from north to south. The oldest parts date from before 550 BC. The oldest part of the city wall come from 450 – 425 BC. The Asklepion in the southwest corner was built in the 400 -350 BC period, as a reorganization of an older sanctuary. In the years 375 – 350 BC, a new wall extended farther south. The 2nd century BC saw major building programs. The wall was again extended southwards. A new agora was formed, and the Asklepion reorganized. Public baths were built in the northeastern part of the city about 100 BC. A Serapium was built in the southeastern corner in the first century B.C. Around 100 B.C., a Roman city surrounded by a wall (750 x 350 m) was built on a hill about 150 meters west of Neapolis where there had previously been a structure that was probably the Roman praesidium. We will refer to this area as the Roman City; it is also called the Republican City . Streets were laid out in a rectangular grid, and a large forum occupied the center of the southern half. Just outside the south wall were an amphitheater and a palaestra. Three large houses, two of them with gardens, have been found northeast of the forum and one to the southeast of it. The northern half of the city remains unexcavated. Once development of the Roman City began, Neapolis seems to have been little changed. The two walls between them were dismantled, but – rather strangely – replaced by a single wall, probably in connection with the creation of the Municipium Emporiae in about 36 – 27 B.C.
Neapolis was abandoned in the course of the second half of the first century AD. The Roman City seems to have ceased development at about that time but remained inhabited to nearly the end of the third century. This abandonment of a once-thriving trading town is probably connected with the silting up of the harbor. The mouth of the Fluvià River has shifted seven kilometers to the north, while Palaiapolis, once an island, is now a hill rising out of lowland where the harbor once was.
Publicly funded excavation of the northeastern part of Neapolis and the forum of the Roman City was conducted in 1846-8. Further systematic studies were conducted from 1908 to 1936 under E. Gandía, who took a great interest in stratigraphy before it was common to do so. The Spanish Civil War brought this work to an end, but Gandía&amp;rsquo;s day books have been preserved. Work was resumed in the 1940&amp;rsquo;s and 1950&amp;rsquo;s by M. Almagro, with recent work by R. Mar and J. Ruiz de Arbulo, and B. Tang. Tang emphasizes that it is often difficult or impossible to determine whether a space in a house in Neapolis was open or covered. The difficulty should not be so great in the case of gardens, for any sort of paving or hammered earth rules out the possibility of a garden. She identifies gardens in N5 and N7 and notes that also N 52 near the northern end of the western edge and N 75 on the northern edge “appear to have been provided with gardens or terraces.”

  Location Villa Fortunatus
Villa Fortunatus (Pleiades)
Location Description Fraga sits astride the Cinca river about 86 kilometers northwest of Tarragona and 103 kilometers east of Zaragoza. About 15 kilometers downstream, the Cinca is joined by the Segre and after another 5 kilometers they join the Ebro, which flows into the Mediterranean about 70 kilometers south west of Tarragona.
Garden Villa of Fortunatus
Keywords  peristyle houses mosaic  Garden Description On the left bank of the Cinca about 5 km upstream (north) of Fraga, at the top of a steep bank, this villa sits some fifteen meters above the river below. At high water, the villa could have fairly easily floated its products to the sea. It had a view of the fertile plain on the right bank. The site has been known since at least 1893 and was excavated almost clandestinely between 1926 and 1936; no reports are known. The site was occupied from the Republican period, but a new atrium-style house was constructed in the second century. At the end of the third or beginning of the fourth century, a peristyle (20.5 x 17 m.) with a garden was added. In the center of the north side was a long, narrow, brick pool raised above ground level. On it were paintings of fish and aquatic plants. Both ends of the pool are semicircular. At the east end of the pool was a well, 12-14 meters deep, which provided water for the garden. The galleries surrounding the garden were all paved in mosaic. In the triclinium or reception room on the south side of the garden the mosaic, with floral designs and animals, bears in its border the name of builder written in two parts, FORTU and NATUS, separated by the Christian symbol of the crossed Χ and Ρ and the letters ω and α. Later, a palaeochristian chapel was installed and remained intact until the sixth century. (B?)

This division lasted until late antiquity, when Tarraconensis was subdivided into three provinces: Tarraconensis, whose capital continued to be Tarraco (Tarragona), Carthaginiensis, with Carthago Nova (Catagena) as its capital, and Gallaecia, whose capital was Bracara Augusta (Braga, in northern Portugal).
The Mediterranean trio of wine, oil and cereals are the crops most frequently mentioned by all the classical authors when referring to the Iberian Peninsula. These were not the only plants cultivated here. Trogus Pompey, in his Universal History (44. 1-2), praises, as well as those products, the fertility of the soil itself, the benevolence of its climate, the opportune and abundant rains which enable all types of fruits to be gathered, thus supplying every need. He describes the linen and esparto grass as of the highest quality. Strabo recorded the tradition of irrigation as a common practice in pre-Roman agriculture (Strabo 3.2.5). This was continued by the Romans, as shown by the number of aqueducts, dams and small reservoirs still to be found on Spanish soil. Pliny, during his stay as procurator in Spain in the first century, gives more specific descriptions of the flora throughout his Natural History (Book XVI). Martial (Epigrams II) refers to myrtle, box and laurel, as common elements to be found in the garden of country houses in Spain.
It is not strange, therefore, that gardening, the work of the topiarius, was usual in Iberian houses, as this study shows. It was not, however, totally new to Spanish territory. Although there are no literary references to gardening in the Pre-Roman era, it must have been part of Iberian culture, as is proved in an unusual way in the northwest of the peninsula in the area under the influence of Greek culture from the city of Emporion (Ampurias or Empuriae). A Hellenic establishment there, Rhode (Rosas), in the third century BC minted drachmas with a rose as the emblem. There were sacred woods connected with the cities. Close to Augustas Emeritas was Lucus Feroniae. Dedicated to Augustus was Lucus Augusti, which gave rise to the present-day Lugo, in Galicia, and another Lucus existed in the environs of Gijón, the Lugo de Llanera (Blázquez, p. 24).
There has been little research on the gardens in the Roman settlements in Spain and Portugal. In drawing up the list of sites with gardens for this catalog, we have accepted that a garden existed when it was so labeled by the excavators. There are, however, many other probable gardens which we have included. Gorges found just under forty villas where enough remained to draw a plan. In them, certain features help to identify a garden. A peristyle alerts us to suspect a garden, but peristyle courtyards were sometimes paved with stones or bricks over a layer of lime. They were clearly not gardens. But if the courtyard had soil in it, it was in all probability a garden. Fountains, fountain statues, and pools are typical of a garden since water is indispensable for a garden. Most peristyles in Roman villas in Spain had ornamental irrigation channels, semicircular pools, wells or pools that gave the impression of still water that, nevertheless, endowed the garden with a cool humidity that favored the cultivation of plants. In Spain, peristyles with drainage are found in the first and second centuries AD and are also common in the late Empire. Certain types of statuary intimately connected with vegetation and nature are found in gardens, such as divinities related to Bacchus and his circle. At Pompeii, Diana, a garden goddess, sometimes paired with Apollo, is also found. Herms were placed on pilasters, as the examples in situ from Pompeii show. Characteristic of Roman villas was the way in which they opened out to the countryside onto a grand vista of gardens and parks filled with fountains.
The roughly triangular province of Tarraconensis, by far the largest of the three provinces of the Iberian Peninsula, stretched across the north side of modern Spain and down the east coast as far as Almeria. On the Atlantic coast, it reached as far south as present Oporto.

Location Description Fraga sits astride the Cinca river about 86 kilometers northwest of Tarragona and 103 kilometers east of Zaragoza. About 15 kilometers downstream, the Cinca is joined by the Segre and after another 5 kilometers they join the Ebro, which flows into the Mediterranean about 70 kilometers south west of Tarragona.
Garden Villa Romana
Keywords  catch basin drains peristyles  Garden Description This large villa, with both a pars urbana and a pars rustica is on the right (south) bank of the Irati river just below the Foz de Lumbier, a gorge cut by the river through a limestone hill.
The villa was discovered by chance in the course of agricultural work in 1921. A number of mosaics were immediately removed to the provincial museum in Pamplona. Systematic excavation was undertaken by Vázquez de Parga and Taracena in the summers between 1942 and 1947. Results were published by Taracena in 1949 and 1950.
It had a first phase dating perhaps from the end of the first century CE. Taracena believed it was destroyed by fire. Little is known of this early phase. A new villa was built in the first third of the 4th century. In addition to the elegant pars urbana there were extensive facilities for cereal, wine, and oil production. The entrance seems to have been from the south. After a short entrance came a long gallery with polychrome geometric mosaics extending along the south side of a garden with a large central pool. The pool was fed by rainwater from the roofs; an interesting spherical catch basin was found on the south edge of the garden. A drain led off to the east. A low wall ran around the garden. On the north side of the garden a wide passage led straight into the middle of the south portico of the central peristyle. All four porticoes were paved in mosaics. In 1949, Taracena offered a detailed description of the courtyard:
The peristyle is the organic center of the second residence. It measures 10.45 by 9.22 meters, and its date of construction can be determined because in the the course of firming up the low wall surrounding it was found a coin of Constantine. Moreover, in exploring the subsoil at a depth of 50 centimeters, the level corresponding to the first villa, another coin of the late empire was found. Together, they seem to confirm that the peristyle was built in the 4th century, possibly in its first third. Inside the peristyle, near the wall, was found a dolium and near the wall on the south side was a line of irregular stones which perhaps formed the border of a flower bed.
Even though there are no other remains of bed borders, trellis, or paths nor any trace of plantings which would help us to imagine the interior of the peristyle, we have to suppose it enlivened by some small garden, for a plain earth patio surrounded by mosaics would have been of no use for agricultural work. Moreover, we have found peristyles of these dimensions in Clunia with a strip of garden a meter wide running around the inside of the bounding wall and limited on the inside by bricks in the ground. This peristyle at Liedena, however has only a central well whose puteal is lost. The well is 90 centimeters in diameter, lined with small-stone ashlar laid rather irregularly without mortar. At 7.2 meters, it reaches groundwater. Blas Taracena Aguirre, 1949, p.16
The oecus or principal reception room is the room with an apse facing the southwest corner of the peristyle. It is one of the few rooms resting on foundations from the first villa. Adjacent to its south side is a rectangular area which may have had a garden in the center. Further south was a fairly large open area. Possibly it was a garden, but a palestra associated with the nearby baths seems more likely.

      <description>Province Hispania Tarraconensis
Tarraconensis(Pleiades)
Province Description In 236 BC, to offset Carthage&amp;rsquo;s loss of Sicily and Sardinia in the First Punic War, Hamilcar Barca led an expedition into Hispania to establish a colony there. Through force of arms and diplomacy, he spread Carthaginian influence as far north as Barcellona, which bears his name. In 230 BC, Hasdrubal, his son-in-law, established Qart Hadast that became Carthago Nova in Roman times and Cartagena today. After the death of Hasdrubal, Hannibal, Hamilcar&amp;rsquo;s oldest son, took command, attacked Saguntum, and in 218 set out for Italy leaving his younger brother, Hasdrubal, in command in Spain. Through the Alps, he descended into Italy and threatened Rome for fourteen years. Roman armies under the brothers Gnaeus and Publius Cornelius Scipio kept Hasdrubal in check and prevented his reinforcing Hannibal. They were both killed by the Carthaginians in 212. Two years later, another Publius Cornelius Scipio, the 25-year-old son of the late general of the same name, was sent to Spain. The next year, he captured New Carthage and, in 206 at the battle of Ilipa (about 15 km north of Savilla) destroyed most of the Carthaginians&amp;rsquo; numerically superior army and ended their hold on Spain. Scipio settled his wounded veterans nearby at a place he called Italica to remind them of their origins. Today, it is one of the best Roman archaeological sites in Italy. After a quick trip back to Rome, where he was elected consul, he returned to Spain and went on to attack Carthage itself. Hannibal was recalled to Africa, but Scipio annihilated his army in 202. Rome thus came into possession of the Mediterranean coast of Iberia.
If Rome was drawn into Hispania to keep the Carthaginians there from supporting Hannibal in Italy, it missed the opportunity offered by Hannibal&amp;rsquo;s defeat to get out of Spain honorably. Instead, in 197 BC it created two new Roman provinces, Hispania Citerior whose capital was Carthago Nova and Hispania Ulterior with Corduba as its capital. Soon after, Rome launched a long war to subjugate the Lusitani, Celtiberians on the west coast. During Sulla&amp;rsquo;s dictatorship, the Lusitani were again in revolt, this time under the able leadership of the Roman general Quintus Sertorius, who sought to create an independent, Roman-like state in Hispania. He established a senate and schools for the sons of the local nobility.
Augustus&amp;rsquo;s conquest of Hispania produced a new territorial division that replaced the earlier two-province organization of the region. Augustus divided the whole of the peninsula into three provinces: Hispania Citerior or Tarraconensis, with its capital Tarraco (Tarragona); Hispania Ulterior Baetica, with its capital Corduba (Córdoba); and Hispania Ulterior Lusitania, or Emerita Augusta, with its capital Mérida. The provinces, in turn, were subdivided in administrative legal units, or conventus. The western lands stayed part of the newly demarcated Lusitania, areas into which Romanization had hardly penetrated, in contrast to the other areas of the peninsula where the classical tradition had been incorporated quite early. This division lasted until late antiquity, when Tarraconensis was subdivided into three provinces: Tarraconensis, whose capital continued to be Tarraco (Tarragona), Carthaginiensis, with Carthago Nova (Catagena) as its capital, and Gallaecia, whose capital was Bracara Augusta (Braga, in northern Portugal).

Garden House of Condes de Barcelona Street
Keywords  peristyle porticoes columns  Garden Description Excavations in the late 1940s and 1950s brought to light the remains of an urban house. Among the structures identified was a peristyle. The presence of a fountain and the existence of a dividing screen, or pluteus, caused Balil to assert that the house must have contained gardens. Two porticos were identified, a larger one in which six columns were recovered (a) and a smaller one with two columns (b). In the center of the larger portico was an L-shaped nympheum or fountain. A lively mosaic in the southwest corner dates the house to the beginning of the second century. Each porticus may have contained a garden.

Italica (Pleiades)
Location Description In 206 BC Publius Cornelius Scipio settled wounded veterans of the battle of Ilipa in an existing Turdentanian town which he renamed Italica to remind the settlers and their descendants of their origins. Three centuries later, it was still a town of some 14 hectares, less than a fourth the size of Pompeii and much smaller than neighboring Hispalis (Pleiades) (Sevilla) or Corduba (Pleiades). Little is known of this town archaeologically because it lies under modern Santiponce.
Italica underwent a major expansion during the reign of the emperor Hadrian, a native of the town. A new area of 30 hectares to the northwest of the old city was enclosed with walls, laid out in an orthogonal plan, and provided with aqueduct water and a well-designed sewer system. Imperial-style baths were built, and a vast and innovative monument to Hadrian’s adopted father Trajan, the Traianeum, was erected. Just north of the new walls an amphitheater accommodating 25,000 spectators was constructed. Dio Cassius says (69.10.1) says that Hadrian showed his patria great honor and bestowed on it many splendid gifts. Style and construction techniques point to imperial and even eastern influence in the layout, the baths, and the Traianeum. Mileposts on a new road leading north proclaim his patronage, the aqueduct is almost surely his work, and his initials are found on some lead pipes.
Garden House of Hylas
Keywords  basins (vessels) fountains mosaics (visual works) nymphs peristyles (columnades) reception rooms  Garden Description This house, with three garden areas, is just east of the Santiponce cemetery. The principal garden, to the south, had a fountain with a rectangular basin in the center. The walls of the basin were covered with mosaics representing fish and molluscs. To the east opened a triclinium, identifiable by the U-shaped design of the floor mosaic. To the north of the principal garden was a large room with a double opening onto the garden. It could well have been either a reception room or a second triclinium.
To the east of this room was a second garden; low walls with the columns of the peristyle resting on them separated the garden from the surrounding galleries. Three of these – on the north, south and west sides – were paved with geometric mosaics; on the east side was a fairly large room with a doorway opening onto the street. Whether or not this was the main entrance will not be clear until the southern corner of the house has been excavated. Two rooms with mosaic floors opened off the south gallery; and two more, off the north gallery. One of the north rooms had a mosaic floor with an emblem showing Hylas carried off by the nymphs. This mosaic gives the house its name and has been removed to the Archaeological Museum in Sevilla.
To the west of the central reception room or triclinium was the third garden, which survives in much worse condition than the eastern one. It also likely had a peristyle and certainly it had a small rectangular pool in the middle.

Location Italica
Italica (Pleiades)
Location Description In 206 BC Publius Cornelius Scipio settled wounded veterans of the battle of Ilipa in an existing Turdentanian town which he renamed Italica to remind the settlers and their descendants of their origins. Three centuries later, it was still a town of some 14 hectares, less than a fourth the size of Pompeii and much smaller than neighboring Hispalis (Pleiades) (Sevilla) or Corduba (Pleiades). Little is known of this town archaeologically because it lies under modern Santiponce.
Italica underwent a major expansion during the reign of the emperor Hadrian, a native of the town. A new area of 30 hectares to the northwest of the old city was enclosed with walls, laid out in an orthogonal plan, and provided with aqueduct water and a well-designed sewer system. Imperial-style baths were built, and a vast and innovative monument to Hadrian’s adopted father Trajan, the Traianeum, was erected. Just north of the new walls an amphitheater accommodating 25,000 spectators was constructed. Dio Cassius says (69.10.1) says that Hadrian showed his patria great honor and bestowed on it many splendid gifts. Style and construction techniques point to imperial and even eastern influence in the layout, the baths, and the Traianeum. Mileposts on a new road leading north proclaim his patronage, the aqueduct is almost surely his work, and his initials are found on some lead pipes.
Garden House of the Birds
Keywords  courtyards fountains mosaics (visual works) peristyles (columnades) vestibules  Garden Description This large, typical ‘peristyle house’ had a courtyard that provided light for all the rooms of the house. The entrance was on the southwest side of the house from the main street leading from the gate where the visitor enters. After a small vestibule and a wide fauces, one came directly into the peristyle garden. Beneath it was a cistern in which rainwater was collected; the water was accessed by means of a well and winch. Water also came from an aqueduct to a fountain on the façade of the house. The peristyle took up a quarter of the total area of the house.
To the left of the entering guest was the reception room with an interesting mosaic of the birds, each bird in its own square. Straight ahead, behind the peristyle, was a large triclinium with a good view of the garden. Moreover, beside the triclinium and presumably visible from it through a window was a small garden with a peristyle of two columns on two sides and four on one side. Most of this garden was occupied by an ornate pool with semicircular extensions at the corners. On the other side of the triclinium was another pool with long steps descending into it suggesting that it was for swimming. It was surrounded by a patio. Opening onto this patio were five rooms with mosaic floors. To the visitor&amp;rsquo;s right on entering the garden from the southwest were found traces of a niche with a mosaic pavement above which had once been the lararium.

Garden House of the Deep Trench
Keywords  courtyards peristyles (columnades) porticoes vestibules  Garden Description In late antiquity, a new city wall was built excluding most of the Hadrianic addition. This house, however, remained inside the new wall and was therefore occupied longer and is somewhat better preserved than most other houses of the second century expansion. The street along its south side led to the front steps at the east end of the Trajaneum. The entrance to the house was on the east side from the street. From the entrance, one came into the vestibule, and then to the east portico of the peristyle, which begins at the right side of the figure. The columns of the peristyle were of brick covered with painted stucco. In the center of the courtyard was a pool lined with opus signinum. In its bottom were some round planting pots in which aquatic plants had been rooted. In the middle of this pool, there was a second, smaller pool with a lobed center. In the south gallery was a niche, presumably for a lararium.

Garden House of the Rhodian Peristyle
Keywords  courtyards mosaics (visual works) peristyles (columnades)  Garden Description This house is on the top of a hill and has thus been exposed to more erosion and pillage of stone than most. The entrance was on the east side and led into the peristyle. One of its galleries was higher than the other three. Vitruvius 6.7.3 used the term “Rhodian” to describe such peristyles, and this feature gave the house its modern name (reference). Only two rooms around the courtyard are in good enough condition to be interpreted. One is marked as a triclinium by the shape of its checker-board mosaic. The other had rolls of foliage. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, we may guess that the central courtyard was a garden.

Keywords  columns (architectural elements) courtyards pedestals peristyles (columnades) porticoes statues  Garden Description The Italica Theater makes use of the side of a hill to support most of its gradería, as do all known theaters in Spain. It was built in the oldest sector of the city and in a location earlier occupied by a simpler structure. The theater had a portico behind the scaena in which there was a chapel to Isis in the second century AD. The portico with heavy sandstone columns covered in stucco surrounded a grand courtyard. At some point low walls were constructed between the columns, and pedestals for honorific statues were placed on top of the low walls. When the ground level in the courtyard was raised (possibly for the creation of a garden) a wall was built to keep earth from entering the portico.

Named the Elephant tomb after a statue of an elephant found just at the entrance of the repository. (Fig. 7, b). In a corner of the tomb, there was a very regular kitchen where the servants could prepare the “refrigeri” dinner (Fig. 7, k). Nearby a pit (Fig. 7, p) furnished water both to the kitchen and to a nearby vast ritual basin for purification (Fig. 7, r). The triclinium for the relatives was set just outside the tomb (Fig. 7, a) while a stone bench was set around tables cut in the rock (Fig. 7, c) for the servants and other family’s dependents. Gardens may well have occupied the free spaces outside the tomb. It is certainly one of the most interesting tomb that I have visited, and has features often present in Punic tombs of the North Africa. Thus I reconstructed (Fig. 8) and also photographed it (Fig. 9).

In its center is a peristyle, which was surrounded by galleries roofed with cross vaulting supported by brick pillars of rectangular cross-section with abutting pilasters making them cruciform in shape. In the center of the peristyle is a pool notable for its curves. It surrounds a circular planter for a tree or flowers.

The early Imperial phase of the villa contained a peristyle courtyard with a pool, central drain and possibly a garden. During the late Imperial phase (fourth century AD), the pool was converted into a double fountain with two semicircular exedras on its short sides, which housed sculptures of Mithra and Dionysus. The space which may have been a garden was transformed into a second pool around the original one by paving it and building a low wall at the base of the peristyle. The ruins show this second state.

Location Description Garden Sanctuary
Keywords  exedrae (site elements) porticoes  Garden Description The sanctuary occupies various terraces and dominates the city below. The plan of the sanctuary follows a Hellenistic model, late-Republican in date. The structure is symmetrical in design with an apsidal space backed by the temple and its dependencies. The sanctuary was constructed in the second half of the first century AD and was dedicated perhaps to the Imperial cult. It was approached by means of two symmetrically placed ramps leading to a rectangular terrace on which animal sacrifices may have taken place. By way of stairs one reached two higher terraces on either side of the temple complex. These terraces were surrounded on two sides by porticoes. They were paved in opus signinum. In the upper terrace there was a central pool, as well as small circular holes in the pavement for plants or trees. From this garden terrace there was access to the exedra and the forecourt of the temple at a still higher level.

Quesada (Pleiades)
Location Description Garden Villa Bruñel
Keywords  apses buttresses courtyards fountains mosaics (visual works) peristyles (columnades) porticoes rills  Garden Description This villa, 5 kilometers north of the center of Quesada, was excavated in eight campaigns between 1965 and 1971, and had multiple phases of construction. The north end of the villa appears as a normal peristyle villa. Directly across the middle of the peristyle and its garden, a mighty wall slices slices the peristyle in two halves running east-west. Beyond the wall, the peristyle and garden continue. But the east-west wall turns out to be the north side of a vast double-apsed hall, which is followed, further south, by another villa wrapping around a large courtyard with covered galleries on all four sides, while off to the southeast, there is another peristyle with garden, porticoes, and surrounding rooms.
In the first phase several features, such as the bases of the four buttresses along the western edge, and the semicircular structure in the middle of the large courtyard, were established. Fragments of oil lamps datable to the second century AD were also found.
Sometime in the third or fourth century AD, to judge by the mosaics, an elegant, standard peristyle villa was built in a second phase of construction. In the center of the garden was a rectangular rill and inside the rill, a fountain with a pool lined, like the rill, with opus signinum. The inner wall of the rill had a raised, fluted moulding on top. The porticoes on four sides around the peristyle were paved in mosaics, now restored and returned to their original places. The oecus [14] was on the south looking north over the garden.
At some time in the fourth century AD, the southern half of this house was demolished to make way for the constructions of the third phase. The enormous court (46.7 x 13.6 m) with apses at each end lay along the north side of the new construction.
At the western end of the south side of the templum was a large rectangular open area (20 x 15.5 m) called the gran patio. It was surrounded on all four sides by covered passageways, and looks very like a garden, though without ornament such as a fountain. Probably not a peristyle. The surrounding passageways were all paved with opus signinum. On the inside walls of the east gallery there remain pieces of stucco with crude painting of squares, rectangles, stems of plants, and green leaves. These corridors definitely had roofs because they were found filled with the debris of the collapsed roofs, mixed with ashes. The walls surrounding the gran patio were found reaching a height of about 80 cm, the same as all the other walls in the area. It seems quite possible that the walls held up the roof and that they had windows in them that could have been closed by wooden vanes. The walls have a peculiarity at the southwest corner. The west wall does not meet the south wall squarely but wraps around it leaving a gateway about 60 cm wide and two or three meters long through which one could enter the central area.
The gran patio and its galleries were bordered on the east by a line of rooms, two of them opening onto it and the others onto what was clearly the residential area further east. There were also two passageways between the two areas. This residential area has a normal peristyle courtyard (8 x 6 m) with a garden. Drainage from the garden went off to the south, while the northern part of the residential area drained across and under the gran patio. In the structures of the third phase, there were no mosaics and no sculptures found. On the other hand, a bronze farm bell with iron clapper, lots of agricultural implements, and some horse gear were found.
Sotomayor did not think that the gran patio was a garden, and proposed that it might have been a coral for ‘lesser herds’ (ganado menor), by which he presumably meant mainly sheep. He pointed out that there was no ornament, such as a pool or fountain in the middle of the area. While the templum was clearly not a garden, it had no masonry floor save what it had inherited from the second phase of the villa. It seems, however, to have had a wooden or reed roof, for carbonized portions of beams suitable for supporting the roof were found.

House House of Gilded Stones
Keywords  peristyles (Roman courtyards) courtyards columns (architectural elements) fountains mosaics (visual works) porticoes  House Description  The living space was organized in U on three side of a garden with peristyle. An entrance on the south formed part of a porch [1] which led to the large vestibule [8] (8.5 x 6.4 m) which opened directly onto the peristyle [23]. From the stratigraphy of the soil it is not possible to know whether this peristyle court was planted or whether it was tamped earth. This courtyard (15.7 x 11.4 m) with an open area of 230 square meters is surrounded on all four sides by porticoes 2.5 meters wide. The columns have disappeared. A column with a phallus-formed top formed a fountain that was perhaps part of the décor of the peristyle; the column rested on a socle pierced by a channel for a conduit of lead which continued through the center of the column. A rectangular pool (7 x 3 m) with a semicircular apse of 2.5 meter diameter, perhaps ornamented by a fountain, occupied the northern half of the central area of the peristyle court. A lead pipe coming from the baths supplied water. The drain cut diagonally across the southern half of the courtyard and continued to the wall along the east side of the house, where it turned and ran parallel to this wall down to the channeled stream on the other side of the street to the south of the house.. On the west were rooms with concrete floors, perhaps bedrooms, except for the central room of the wing [16] (5 x 4.2 m) with a somewhat elevated floor in opus signinum. On the axis of the pool, to the north, was the most spacious room [20] (60 square m) which served as a triclinium; its presumed mosaic is totally lost. Room [18], with a mosaic floor, could have been a summer dinning room in connection with this garden, especially because of its position to the north. Further to the north, at the back of the lot, the house had a large garden [25] of 276 square meters with a portico [24] along the south side, 18.6 meters in length and 3 meters wide, with a floor of pounded earth. Below this portico lay a garden of 276 square meters, which one entered no doubt by steps. Study of the soil has not been able to determine how the place was planted. Was it a pleasure garden or a kitchen garden?

House House with the Cistern
Keywords  porticoes courtyards  House Description This house was exposed during a programmed excavation from 1981 to 1985. It occupies a plot of 1338 square meters facing Voie I, on which it opens through an entrance in the center of its façade. This phase, called the House with the Cistern, was constructed in the last years of the Augustan period on the site of an earlier building, itself Augustan and probably also a dwelling. It was occupied 20 to 25 years before being remodeled. In its unusual quadrilateral shape, no two sides were parallel, but the west and south sides were perpendicular, and the interior walls ran parallel to one or the other of them. The average width (in the east-west direction) was 24 meters and average length 66 meters. The construction was organized around three sides of the courtyard [12] (10 x 8 m); it may have been planted or may have had a simple earthen floor. To the north, a second open space, a court or a garden [17] (roughly 27 x 15 m) took up a third of the lot. A cylindrical structure [16] three meters in diameter, interpreted as a cistern, occupies an extension off the southeast corner. Nearly all of the floors are of pounded earth. Numerous areas of painted plaster have been discovered in the thirteen rooms that ring three sides of the courtyard [12]. However, the quality of the construction remained ordinary.

Garden House of the Large Peristyle
Keywords  peristyles (columnades) colonnades peristyles (Roman courtyards) porticoes  Garden Description  Only its eastern end has been uncovered, and of the rooms for living &amp;ndash; presumably to the west – very little is known. What is known is a large peristyle of unusual form with a center certainly planted as a garden. The long axis of the peristyle ran almost due north to make an angle of about 80 degrees with the street along the north and with the axis of the living areas of the house to the west. The form of the peristyle (32.5 x 18 m with porticoes 3.7 meters wide) would have been a fairly normal, slightly trapezoidal “rectangle” with the south side missing were it not that more than half of the west side was also missing. The colonnade on that side ran straight into a wall, presumably of the neighbor’s house, which jutted out into the southwest corner of our owner’s elegant peristyle courtyard and garden. In the northern part of the courtyard, the presence of a U-shaped channel pool seems well attested but is not shown on the plan.

Keywords  porticoes  Garden Description A century passed before further major modifications. Then the eight columns of the vestibule on the south were removed, and the mosaic floor with the heads of the ocean gods in the four corners (which gives its name to the house) was installed there. In the middle was of the vestibule was a circular pool (diameter 2.5 m) with water jets. North of the first peristyle garden, a huge room [14] was created connecting the first peristyle to the second. In the following peristyle [19], the U-shaped pool with the water jets was eliminated, though the rectangular pool (6.30 x 2.50 m), lined with white marble at the south end of the peristyle was kept. Its bottom was 40 centimeters below the level of the floor of the south portico. Several ovoid horticultural pots (oleae perforatae) in common pale earth ceramic were found against the north wall of this pool. The rest of the north end of the house remained unchanged. It should be added that the area [29] west of large room [30] may have been a third garden.

Location Description Sublocation House of the Ocean Gods
Sublocation Description The northern end of this vast house is just west of the House of Five Mosaics and in the same insula. From the Passage des Grands Entrepôts along this northern limit, it runs over 100 meters southward to the “Voie I” along the south side of the archaeological site. The eastern edge is about 230 meters west of the Rhone. No less than five names have been given to the houses occupying part or all of the site. The following table of these names with approximate dates may help the reader keep them straight. The final house runs just over 100 meters from south to north. The first two houses covered only about the first 66 meters from the south, up to the noticeable kink in the north-south lines. The third house in the above list, the House of the Large Peristyle, was limited to the area north of this kink. The fourth house combined these two, while the last rebuilt the whole area keeping only the outline and a few walls. We describe the houses in chronological order. All plans for these houses are from La maison des dieux ocean, Equipe archèologique departmentale de Saint-Romain-en-Gal, published by Aglas, 1996.
House House of Vestibule with Columns
Keywords  porticoes vestibules colonnades columns (architectural elements) fountains triclinia mosaics (visual works) reception rooms  House Description  In phase I, the house had the L-shape due to the combination of the two previous houses. The main entrance was from the south, past a portico façade, and into a vestibule (12.9 x 11.9 m) that had a double colonnade. A square pool (4 x 4 m) with a water jet occupied its center. To the east and west, the vestibule was framed by rooms and shops. Beyond the vestibule, one came to the first garden [13]. It had a peristyle on four sides (13.5 x 12 m) with an open area of 167 square meters, porticoes 3 meters wide, and columns 3.3 meters high. A rectangular pool (3.5 x18 m) on the axis covered the central third of the garden. A masonry base of a fountain, statue or other ornament was found in the west part of the garden. North of the peristyle, in the center of the main building, was one of the main reception rooms of the house, on the axis of the pool. This triclinium (7.7 x 6.3 m) apparently had a mosaic that has been lost. The surrounding rooms are of small dimensions except for [15], a second reception area. Farther north, a portico [20] opens onto an esplanade [19] which makes the transition from one of the former houses to the other. The level of this free space was 1.4 meters above that of the garden ahead; stairs to the left and right led down. This second large garden (35 x 30 m), open towards the south, is surrounded on the other three sides by a peristyle with porticoes 3.7 meters wide. A channel pool 1.5 meters wide runs around the three sides of the peristyle. It has been proposed to see in room [25] (54 m2) a cold-weather dining room. The west gallery of the portico opened through three doors to the rooms of the building to the northwest. The space [28], with a pounded earth floor may have been intended as another reception room that was not finished. Beyond the corridor [31] there may have been more open space.
Phase III, from around the end of the first century, carried the ideas of Phase II into the first or southern peristyle garden. The pool in the center was converted into space for planting while a U-shaped channel pull was run around the east, south and west sides, while a wider, separate, rectangular pool ran along the north side. The south side had an apse projecting into the garden.

Keywords  domus peristyles (Roman courtyards) porticoes courtyards reception rooms  House Description This vast domus (120 x 60 m) presumably had its principal, monumental entry on the south side, along the Street of the Port. The south peristyle [6] (approximately 13.7 x 9.3 m) was surrounded by four porticoes with floors of terrazzo signinum. Three of them were 2 meters wide; the fourth, on the north, was 3 meters wide and gave access to the principal room [17].
The courtyard of this peristyle was certainly used as a garden. It had a rectangular pool (8.2 x 6.5 m) and within this pool, at the northern end, a semicircular pool. On the axis of the pool, the reception room [17] (11 x 10 m) served also as a transition to the second peristyle [33] with an open area (about 29.3 x 41.3 m) no doubt planted as a garden. The three-meter wide galleries of the porticoes gave access to a whole series of large rooms, one of which [39] had an apse on the outside, west wall. In the center of the garden was placed a first pool of 3 by 5 meters. To the south, a long, narrow second pool in front of room [17] has been only partially excavated. Along the north side of the courtyard was a rectangle (28.2 x 3.4 m) of water with an unusual apse in the center of its south side in the shape of a brace or accolade. In this apse was found a lead pipe. Against this apse was another pool, a square 5.8 meters on a side. The revetment of all of the pools in this northern peristyle was of marble.
In the northern wing of the house, a square reception room [53], 5.8 meters on a side, was centered on the axis of the garden. No mosaic was found in it, but the few remaining fragments of the pavement indicate that it was mainly of marble plaques.

Province Description In 236 BC, to offset Carthage&amp;rsquo;s loss of Sicily and Sardinia in the First Punic War, Hamilcar Barca led an expedition into Hispania to establish a colony there. Through force of arms and diplomacy, he spread Carthaginian influence as far north as Barcellona, which bears his name. In 230 BC, Hasdrubal, his son-in-law, established Qart Hadast that became Carthago Nova in Roman times and Cartagena today. After the death of Hasdrubal, Hannibal, Hamilcar&amp;rsquo;s oldest son, took command, attacked Saguntum, and in 218 set out for Italy leaving his younger brother, Hasdrubal, in command in Spain. Through the Alps, he descended into Italy and threatened Rome for fourteen years. Roman armies under the brothers Gnaeus and Publius Cornelius Scipio kept Hasdrubal in check and prevented his reinforcing Hannibal. They were both killed by the Carthaginians in 212. Two years later, another Publius Cornelius Scipio, the 25-year-old son of the late general of the same name, was sent to Spain. The next year, he captured New Carthage and, in 206 at the battle of Ilipa (about 15 km north of Savilla) destroyed most of the Carthaginians&amp;rsquo; numerically superior army and ended their hold on Spain. Scipio settled his wounded veterans nearby at a place he called Italica to remind them of their origins. Today, it is one of the best Roman archaeological sites in Italy. After a quick trip back to Rome, where he was elected consul, he returned to Spain and went on to attack Carthage itself. Hannibal was recalled to Africa, but Scipio annihilated his army in 202. Rome thus came into possession of the Mediterranean coast of Iberia.
If Rome was drawn into Hispania to keep the Carthaginians there from supporting Hannibal in Italy, it missed the opportunity offered by Hannibal&amp;rsquo;s defeat to get out of Spain honorably. Instead, in 197 BC it created two new Roman provinces, Hispania Citerior whose capital was Carthago Nova and Hispania Ulterior with Corduba as its capital. Soon after, Rome launched a long war to subjugate the Lusitani, Celtiberians on the west coast. During Sulla&amp;rsquo;s dictatorship, the Lusitani were again in revolt, this time under the able leadership of the Roman general Quintus Sertorius, who sought to create an independent, Roman-like state in Hispania. He established a senate and schools for the sons of the local nobility.
Augustus&amp;rsquo;s conquest of Hispania produced a new territorial division that replaced the earlier two-province organization of the region. Augustus divided the whole of the peninsula into three provinces: Hispania Citerior or Tarraconensis, with its capital Tarraco (Tarragona); Hispania Ulterior Baetica, with its capital Corduba (Córdoba); and Hispania Ulterior Lusitania, or Emerita Augusta, with its capital Mérida. The provinces, in turn, were subdivided in administrative legal units, or conventus. The western lands stayed part of the newly demarcated Lusitania, areas into which Romanization had hardly penetrated, in contrast to the other areas of the peninsula where the classical tradition had been incorporated quite early. This division lasted until late antiquity, when Tarraconensis was subdivided into three provinces: Tarraconensis, whose capital continued to be Tarraco (Tarragona), Carthaginiensis, with Carthago Nova (Catagena) as its capital, and Gallaecia, whose capital was Bracara Augusta (Braga, in northern Portugal).
The Mediterranean trio of wine, oil and cereals are the crops most frequently mentioned by all the classical authors when referring to the Iberian Peninsula. These were not the only plants cultivated here. Trogus Pompey, in his Universal History (44. 1-2), praises, as well as those products, the fertility of the soil itself, the benevolence of its climate, the opportune and abundant rains which enable all types of fruits to be gathered, thus supplying every need. He describes the linen and esparto grass as of the highest quality. Strabo recorded the tradition of irrigation as a common practice in pre-Roman agriculture (Strabo 3.2.5). This was continued by the Romans, as shown by the number of aqueducts, dams and small reservoirs still to be found on Spanish soil. Pliny, during his stay as procurator in Spain in the first century, gives more specific descriptions of the flora throughout his Natural History (Book XVI). Martial (Epigrams II) refers to myrtle, box and laurel, as common elements to be found in the garden of country houses in Spain.
It is not strange, therefore, that gardening, the work of the topiarius, was usual in Iberian houses, as this study shows. It was not, however, totally new to Spanish territory. Although there are no literary references to gardening in the Pre-Roman era, it must have been part of Iberian culture, as is proved in an unusual way in the northwest of the peninsula in the area under the influence of Greek culture from the city of Emporion (Ampurias or Empuriae). A Hellenic establishment there, Rhode (Rosas), in the third century BC minted drachmas with a rose as the emblem. There were sacred woods connected with the cities. Close to Augustas Emeritas was Lucus Feroniae. Dedicated to Augustus was Lucus Augusti, which gave rise to the present-day Lugo, in Galicia, and another Lucus existed in the environs of Gijón, the Lugo de Llanera (Blázquez, p. 24).
There has been little research on the gardens in the Roman settlements in Spain and Portugal. In drawing up the list of sites with gardens for this catalog, we have accepted that a garden existed when it was so labeled by the excavators. There are, however, many other probable gardens which we have included. Gorges found just under forty villas where enough remained to draw a plan. In them, certain features help to identify a garden. A peristyle alerts us to suspect a garden, but peristyle courtyards were sometimes paved with stones or bricks over a layer of lime. They were clearly not gardens. But if the courtyard had soil in it, it was in all probability a garden. Fountains, fountain statues, and pools are typical of a garden since water is indispensable for a garden. Most peristyles in Roman villas in Spain had ornamental irrigation channels, semicircular pools, wells or pools that gave the impression of still water that, nevertheless, endowed the garden with a cool humidity that favored the cultivation of plants. In Spain, peristyles with drainage are found in the first and second centuries AD and are also common in the late Empire. Certain types of statuary intimately connected with vegetation and nature are found in gardens, such as divinities related to Bacchus and his circle. At Pompeii, Diana, a garden goddess, sometimes paired with Apollo, is also found. Herms were placed on pilasters, as the examples in situ from Pompeii show. Characteristic of Roman villas was the way in which they opened out to the countryside onto a grand vista of gardens and parks filled with fountains.
The roughly triangular province of Tarraconensis, by far the largest of the three provinces of the Iberian Peninsula, stretched across the north side of modern Spain and down the east coast as far as Almeria. On the Atlantic coast, it reached as far south as present Oporto.

Keywords  peristyles  Garden Description Excavation in 1968 – 1972 at this site, which has been reburied, revealed over half the area of a large, fourth century villa, laid out around a central peristyle garden (31.2 x 28.8 m). The excavations exposed the western half of the site while samples and trenches established the broad outlines of the eastern half. The oecus on the north side had a good view of the garden. Directly across from it were double-horseshoe-shaped baths on the south. Though mosaics are few, other finds indicate that the villa saw an intense and brilliant use during the fourth century and into the fifth, when there are signs of remodelling. The villa was briefly abandoned in Visigoth times, the in the mid-3rd century used as a necropolis.

This was continued by the Romans, as shown by the number of aqueducts, dams and small reservoirs still to be found on Spanish soil. Pliny, during his stay as procurator in Spain in the first century, gives more specific descriptions of the flora throughout his Natural History (Book XVI). Martial (Epigrams II) refers to myrtle, box and laurel, as common elements to be found in the garden of country houses in Spain.
It is not strange, therefore, that gardening, the work of the topiarius, was usual in Iberian houses, as this study shows. It was not, however, totally new to Spanish territory. Although there are no literary references to gardening in the Pre-Roman era, it must have been part of Iberian culture, as is proved in an unusual way in the northwest of the peninsula in the area under the influence of Greek culture from the city of Emporion (Ampurias or Empuriae). A Hellenic establishment there, Rhode (Rosas), in the third century BC minted drachmas with a rose as the emblem. There were sacred woods connected with the cities. Close to Augustas Emeritas was Lucus Feroniae. Dedicated to Augustus was Lucus Augusti, which gave rise to the present-day Lugo, in Galicia, and another Lucus existed in the environs of Gijón, the Lugo de Llanera (Blázquez, p. 24).
There has been little research on the gardens in the Roman settlements in Spain and Portugal. In drawing up the list of sites with gardens for this catalog, we have accepted that a garden existed when it was so labeled by the excavators. There are, however, many other probable gardens which we have included. Gorges found just under forty villas where enough remained to draw a plan. In them, certain features help to identify a garden. A peristyle alerts us to suspect a garden, but peristyle courtyards were sometimes paved with stones or bricks over a layer of lime. They were clearly not gardens. But if the courtyard had soil in it, it was in all probability a garden. Fountains, fountain statues, and pools are typical of a garden since water is indispensable for a garden. Most peristyles in Roman villas in Spain had ornamental irrigation channels, semicircular pools, wells or pools that gave the impression of still water that, nevertheless, endowed the garden with a cool humidity that favored the cultivation of plants. In Spain, peristyles with drainage are found in the first and second centuries AD and are also common in the late Empire. Certain types of statuary intimately connected with vegetation and nature are found in gardens, such as divinities related to Bacchus and his circle. At Pompeii, Diana, a garden goddess, sometimes paired with Apollo, is also found. Herms were placed on pilasters, as the examples in situ from Pompeii show. Characteristic of Roman villas was the way in which they opened out to the countryside onto a grand vista of gardens and parks filled with fountains.
The roughly triangular province of Tarraconensis, by far the largest of the three provinces of the Iberian Peninsula, stretched across the north side of modern Spain and down the east coast as far as Almeria. On the Atlantic coast, it reached as far south as present Oporto.

It did not, however, have a view of the garden but looked along the northeast gallery of the peristyle. That there was a garden is indicated by the presence of a pipe which crossed the northeast portico presumably to supply water for plants or a nymphaeum in the center of the peristyle.

      <description>Province Asia
Province Description The region of what is now modern Turkey became a part of the Roman Empire in 133 BCE, when king Attalos III of Pergamum bequeathed his kingdom to the Roman people. The province included the heartland of the Pergamene kingdom as well as the territories of Mysia, Lydia, Ionia, Caria, western Phrygia and the eastern Aegean islands. Under Augustus in 27 BCE Asia was declared a senatorial province and the governance of a proconsul. The capital of the province was Ephesos, although Pergamon may have fulfilled this role initially. Under Diocletian (284-305 CE) the province was subdivided into smaller administrative units: Hellespontus, Asia, Lydia, Caria, Phrygia I and Phrygia II. Due to its excellent harbors on the west coast and its many navigable rivers, Asia’s water-borne trade with the rest of the Mediterranean flourished. In the second century CE Asia experienced great prosperity, to which the growth and architectural aggrandizement of many of its cities attest. In the area of Kibyra, bordering the regions of Lycia, Caria, Phrygia and Pisidia, numerous inscriptions refer to the large imperial estates of Roman families. Woolen textiles, marble, and timber constituted a significant part of the commodities exported from the province.
While the Romans might have looked to the Greeks for inspiration in philosophy, architecture, sculpture, and the fine arts, the non-Greek peoples of the eastern Mediterranean are their inspiration for luxury, fine-living, and the status conferred by displays of individual wealth (Ath. Deip. 15.690). Asia was a center for such splendor, first in the kingdoms of Lydia, Phrygia, and Lycia, and then continued by the Persian satraps, and later the Hellenistic kings. The Persian paradeisos is particularly well attested in literature referencing Asia. That these gardens are known primarily from Roman-period literary sources indicates their continuing influence. For example, long after the gold of Lydia’s Pactolus River had disappeared, Lydia remained a literary topos, not only for copious wealth, but for a life of luxury set in a landscape of natural abundance. Athenaeus (Deip. 12.515d-f) wrote in the second century CE that
 &amp;quot;The Lydians in their luxury planned parks and made them like gardens and so kept in the shade. For they thought it more dainty not to have the sun’s rays touch them at all&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
 Other districts of Asia captured the Roman imagination: Pliny the Elder writes of an ancient plane tree (Sycamorus orientalis) in Lycia with a girth of sufficient circumference to house a grotto in its hollow trunk, ornamented with pumice and moss with provisions for 18 people to dine there (Plin. HN 12.5).
The paradeisoi of the Persian satraps are of particular influence on the introduction of horti and gardens of Rome. The paradeisos, from the Persian, paira daeza, or “enclosed place,” is a term that had evolved by the Hellenistic period to mean a large enclosed park with luxurious gardens as well as orchards, collections of trees, crops, and hunting areas. It was at Sardis that the Greek Lysander visited Cyrus the Younger, a visit recorded by Klearchos and retold by Xenophon. It is an essential moment in garden history recounted for the Romans by Cicero (Sen. 59). These paradeisoi, in the sense of luxurious orchards, are said by the Romans to have been brought to Greece by Kimon (Aristotole apud Plut. Cim. 10; cf. Cic. de Off. 2.64), and were adopted by Hellenistic kings throughout Greece and southern Italy during the late Hellenistic period. The hunting parks at Daskyleion and Celenae are also vividly described by Xenophon (see An. 1.2.7, 2.4.14 and Oec. 4.13). Xenophon also describes how paradeisoi were occupied or cut down by armies during the fourth and third centuries BCE. Appreciation for these parks apparently continued, and Seleucus of Syria took over the royal paradeisos at Sardis (Plut. Dem. 50). Years of instability followed, so it is difficult to know what the Romans themselves thought of paradeisoi in Asia in the second and first centuries BCE. Notable examples of paradeisoi, in some form, may have been visible to Romans visiting Asia, as well. For example, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus is now thought by its excavators to have been set in a grove or park.
Thus, the paradeisos, the alsos, the gymnasium, and the quadriporticus are not forms the Romans suddenly “discovered.” They had had a long influence and were integrated into the Hellenistic architectural forms of the Italic landscape. In the second century BCE, however, when the Roman generals began to define themselves as rulers of an empire, they turned directly to the palaces and paradeisoi of the Hellenistic monarchs to establish their power, to display spoils of war, and to create the luxurious setting for life in Rome. They further adapted the evolving quadriporticus form for display to the public
Despite the importance of Asia Minor in the history of the Roman landscape, archaeological evidence is scant. The excavators contacted for the gardens of this region indicated that parks, gardens, and other planted areas have yet to become a subject of research design for the region and finds appear to be few — primarily inscriptions and wall paintings. Most of the smaller domestic courtyards — often the most manageable to investigate — are paved. The larger palaestrae, gymnasia, and enclosed open spaces have not been investigated for landscape architectural and planting features, although recently an important campaign of work in the South Agora at Aphrodisias is setting an important precedent (CROSS-REF). The gardens included in this province include areas with dirt and incomplete paved surfaces, as well as sites where the excavators have some level of optimism that future study may yet reveal more about gardens. The subject of designed landscapes, gardens, and planted areas in Asia Minor remains in its archaeological infancy.

Pergamum (Pleiades)
Location Description Pergamum, a fortress site in Mysia near the Aegean coast, was transformed into an architectural center under the Attalid dynasty (282-133 B.C.). Attalus the III wrote treatises on gardens, raised poisonous plants, made wax models (Plut. Demet. 20.2), and upon his death, left the kingdom of Mysia to the Romans. It became one of the most important Roman cities of Asia, and current scholarship has revealed its significance as an influence on the art and architecture of Rome. The range of designed open spaces includes sanctuaries, gymnasia, palaestra, and agoras, all of which were renovated during the Roman period. No archaeological remains of planting features have been reported, but an inscription records a law prohibiting the deliberate planting of trees near walls (SEG XIII 521.11.158-61).

Keywords  peristyles (Roman courtyards) porticoes reception rooms apsed pools fountains triclinia nymphaea (garden structures)  House Description The house had a linear plan starting from a garden on the south, then on the north side of the garden, a façade gallery, then several rooms, and finally a peristyle on the north. It went through three phases with the changes concentrated on the south garden. In the first phase, this garden [13] (23.5 x 11.5 m) was bordered on the north by a portico [12] 2.5 meters wide. In the garden, adjacent to this portico and directly in front of the principal reception room [8] was a rectangular pool (7.5 x 4 m) with an apse in the center of the south side. It probably had a fountain.
In the second phase, this south garden was reduced by the addition of two lateral porticoes (2.5 m wide) on its east and west sides. In keeping with the local fashion of the time, it was given a U-shaped rill or channel pool running around the outer rim of the garden. A 1.5 meter apse on the north side is slightly off the axis of the reception room [9]. In the center of the garden was a little square pool (1.5 m on a side) with an apse on the north. It was surrounded by benches in a U to form a masonry summer triclinium facing north. On the south side of the benches was a nymphaeum of three niches, a central semicircular one and a rectangular one to either side. At present, a water jet has been put in the middle of each of them. The final phase lasted about fifty years, beginning in the first half of the third century. The south garden was enlarged by the suppression of the east portico. The U-shaped channel pool lost its lateral arms, so that it became a simple rectangle (18 x 1.5 m) and it was made shallower. The apse, in practically the same place, was off-center to the west. The garden kept its summer triclinium and nympheum.

Keywords  porticoes courtyards peristyles (Roman courtyards) opus signinum opus sectile (visual works) mosaics (visual works) triclinia  House Description Phase I: This phase is sometimes called the “House with the Off-Center Pool.” It occupied an area of 481 square meters with a usable covered surface of 213 square meters. Constructed after 138, it was built in part on the site and foundations of a commercial building going back to the middle of the first century. It was used only twenty to thirty years. It had an elongated, somewhat trapezoidal plan with two groups of rooms, one to the north and one to the south of a peristyle [5]. Most of the walls in short, east-west direction, were not perpendicular to the walls in the long, north-south direction. One entered the house by a modest doorway 1.8 meters wide into a little vestibule [1] which then led directly to the east portico of the courtyard, where presumably a garden grew. The principal room [7] (6.1 x 11.5 m) was on the south of the peristyle (8.5 x 11.5 m), where the gallery was wider and the roof presumably higher than on the other sides. This reception room had a good view of the rectangular pool along the south side of the garden. This 70-centimenter-deep pool (8.35 x 1.8 m) was lined in opus signinum.
Phase II: This phase (called the House of the Five Mosaics by those who call the first phase the House of the Off-center Pool), dates from the end of the second century, probably from 160 - 180. Although more luxurious than the first phase, it nevertheless kept the plan of the original. The covered area was enlarged to 293 square meters; but the garden, though reduced, remained central. The entrance [1] was shifted towards the south and got a more monumental gate 4.25 meter wide. In the southern wing, the main interior walls were rotated from their eastern end to be perpendicular to the north-south walls, with the result that the covered area was enlarged at the expense of the garden, which was reduced to 10-by-8 meters. It was bordered on the north and east by 1.5-meter-wide galleries, while the gallery to the south, though only 1.3 meters wide, had a floor of opus sectile. The east portico [2] became the only way to get from one of groups of rooms to the other. The garden received a U-shaped rill pool lined with white marble; the branches were of different length and less than a meter wide. The space left free at the end of the northern branch of the pool was the only access to the central part of the garden. In the two corners of the pool were found socles for some decorative elements, perhaps statues or fountains. Some parts of valves were found in the overflow from the pool. In the south wing, a large room [8] (7.5 x 7.0 m) opened onto the axis of the garden. With a mosaic of the xenia type, it apparently served as the triclinium. To the east, at the south end of the eastern gallery, was a smaller reception room for visitors [7] (4.0 x 4.5 m). The almost square (5 x 5 m) room [12] at the west end of the northern wing may have been, in the opinion of the excavators, a more familial, every-day triclinium. The house was occupied into the third century, but must have been abandoned, like the rest of the quarter, in the middle of that century.

It was occupied approximately from 60 to 140. The lot covered 947 square meters and has two façade porticoes, one on the rue du Commerce and one on Voie III. The house was arranged around a central trapezoidal courtyard [1] (roughly 7,50 x 6,50 m) which may have been a garden. There were porticoes on only the north and east sides [2 and 3]. They had pounded earth floors; their black and green painted columns give the house its name. A one-meter wide channel pool ran around the north, east and south sides. Later, this pool was made shallower and its bottom covered with a concrete containing calcite crystals. A rectangular pool (5 x 2 m) with an axial apse of 1 meter closed the U-shaped channel pool on the west. A single cutting pot was found during the excavation.

Province Description The history of Roman Africa begins in 146 BC with the destruction of Carthage and the establishment of the province of Africa in the most fertile part of the Carthaginian Empire. The new province covered about 5000 square miles (17,172 square kilometers) of the northern part of modern Tunisia. A praetor governed the area from his headquarters at Utica. The Romans inherited a thriving agriculture developed by the Carthaginians. The climate was hospitable. Wheat and barley were the most important cereals; wine and olive oil were also produced and there were various fruit trees.
Location Hippo Regius
Hippo Regius (Pleiades)
Location Description The city of Hippo Regius overlooks a sheltered bay where, from earliest times, ships could moor. An independent city under the reign of the king Micipsa, the city was involved in the turmoil of the Roman civil wars, with the defeat and the suicide of Metellus Scipio and his ally Juba I. Under Augustus, the city became a municipium, and later a colony under Trajan. The wealthy port was also the residence of the imperial procurator in charge of supplying Rome with wheat. During the fourth century Saint Augustine was the bishop of the city.
Excavations have brought to light the theater, considered to be the largest in Africa, built against the St. Augustine hill; also parts of the forum, a public fountain, the market, the northern and southern baths, the so called Christian district with its basilica and so called villas’ district.
Garden Domus of the Sea Front (Villa du front de mer)
Keywords  peristyles (columnades) peristyles (Roman courtyards) loggias oeci cisterns (plumbing components) basins (vessels)  Garden Description The upper level of this large house (after 330, according to stratigraphic dating) resulted from the joining of three dwellings and was built over two earlier levels, the courtyards or peristyles of which are still unknown. Like a maritime villa, the house had a long loggia, which extended and opened to the sea, towards the northeast. It was excavated first in 1911, then in 1951-52, in 1964 and more recently in 2002 (Plan view, Fig. 1, 2).
The peristyle garden of the house (ca 16.50 x 8.50 m) was enclosed on four sides by a portico supported by twenty marble columns; there was a first floor, as stairs have been found. A large oecus (B3) on the northeast side looked out on the garden. In front of this exedra was a shallow pool, framed by two columns. Behind the pool was a cistern opening covered with a stone slab; on the right and left, two square planters were added at a later period. In that part of the garden, the mosaic pavements of the lower level extended under the garden. On the opposite side, a beautiful semi-circular basin, framed by two fluted columns (now broken), and faced inside with colored marbles, was visible from the entrance of the house (Fig. 2). Between the large door and this basin, the portico was paved with white marble slabs. The open space certainly was a garden (B16) as it was planted with bushes a few years ago.

      <description>Province Africa Proconsularis Africa proconsularis (Pleiades)
Province Description The history of Roman Africa begins in 146 BC with the destruction of Carthage and the establishment of the province of Africa in the most fertile part of the Carthaginian Empire. The new province covered about 5000 square miles (17,172 square kilometers) of the northern part of modern Tunisia. A praetor governed the area from his headquarters at Utica. The Romans inherited a thriving agriculture developed by the Carthaginians. The climate was hospitable. Wheat and barley were the most important cereals; wine and olive oil were also produced and there were various fruit trees.
Location Karthago
Karthago (Pleiades)
Location Description Founded by Tyrians from Phoenicia, Carthage became the capital of a powerful empire that came into conflict with the expanding power of Rome. In 146 BC Carthage was completely destroyed and re-founded as a Roman colony by Augustus who completed Cesar’s initial project. Augustus expanded the new city and encouraged settlements of veterans and civilians. The kingdom of Numidia was transformed into a province and Carthage was raised to the rank of capital. The city not only became the major port through which the wealth of the province flowed to Rome but also became a cultural capital that introduced the African elite to the rest of the empire, making it one of the wealthiest and most cosmopolitan cities in the Mediterranean world. Of the Roman period, the city plan is clearly recognizable. The plan takes as its central axis the summit of the acropolis of Byrsa that divided the city into four quarters of equal size except for the one situated to the northwest. The most remarkable monuments found in Carthage are the Baths of Antonius situated on the seashore at the foot of the hill of Borj Jedid and the villas that stretched along the Odeon’s hill. From the Christian era, several basilicas were found. The necropolis that surrounded the city has also provided important information on the city.
Garden House of Dionysos
Keywords  porticoes columns (architectural elements) basins (vessels)  Garden Description In this very damaged house, a portico on four sides (IV-VII) enclosed a court (VIII) (8 x 11.10 m), which was planted during the building’s second phase dated at the fourth/early fifth century. The northeast and southwest porticos had four columns and the northwest and southeast had five columns.
A low wall was added in between the columns that enclosed the garden. A semi-circular basin attached to a rectangular one oriented northeast/southwest (IX) was placed at the northeast end of the garden. (Plan view, Fig. 1). The house dates from the III-V c.

Garden House of the Aviary (Maison de la Volière)
Keywords  peristyles (columnades) peristyles (Roman courtyards) mosaics (visual works) cisterns (plumbing components) oeci  Garden Description Located on a hill overlooking Carthage, the house of the aviary is divided into two parts: the unit centered on the peristyle in the west, and the ensemble with the reception room in the east (Plan view, Fig. 1).
In the center of the peristyle in the western part of the house was an octagonal area enclosed by a low wall 50 cm high. P. Gauckler, the original excavator, recognized the area as a viridarium. The Aviary mosaic covers the floor space between the portico and the octagonal garden. In the center of each corner of the mosaic was a deep cavity in which a tree was planted. There was a cistern beneath the peristyle.
In the eastern part of the house, a low wall with six semi-circular niches that alternated with five square-shaped niches faced the oecus bordered by a portico. On the wall was laid out a large pool with small niches bordered on each side by two planters. On a higher level of the pool and the planters were three small cascades decorated with parietal mosaics and paintings depicting hunting and fishing scenes. Water coming from the huge cistern complex on the top of the hill ran through the cascades and fell into the pool. This arrangement can be compared to theater decor where nature is displayed. Hence, the oecus bordered by a portico was facing a frons scaenae composed by a pulpitum behind which were lined up the pool and two planters that could be compared to a proscaenium. The house dates from the end of the IInd-IVth century.

Keywords  peristyles (columnades) peristyles (Roman courtyards) alleys (streets) exedrae (site elements) mosaics (visual works)  Garden Description The house was located in the insula delimited by the Decumani North V-VI and the Kardines East VIII-IX and neighboring to the North West the Villa of the Aviary. Unfortunately, the house was badly preserved when Gauckler the excavator discovered it (Plan view, Fig. 1). The peristyle was bounded by four porticoes, which were supported by twelve columns. The courtyard had a central alley that was limited on its two sides by colonnaded low walls that formed a circular exedra on one side and a rectangular exedra on the opposite side facing each other. P. Gauckler mentions that the exedrae were paved with mosaic figures of seashore landscapes, as well as the West portico that welcomed the visitor just after the vestibule. Only small fragments of the mosaics have survived. The central alley of the courtyard was on axis with the oecus.
1-	The North and the East portico lead to an open area that Gauckler identifies as a garden of at least 250m2. The house dates from the IVth. c.

Location Description Pupput is located about three km to the northwest of Hammamed. Two inscriptions inform the designated title of the city, which became a colony (Colonia Aurelia Commoda Pia Felix Augusta Pupput) under the reign of Commodus. The city benefited from a strategic location at the crossroads linking Clupea to Thhuburbo and Carthage to Hadrumetum. Large residential quarters with houses and baths were excavated as well as a large necropolis.

The peristyle is entered from the S. The N wing had a vast oecus-triclinium bordered on both sides by two apartments that each had two rooms and a passage to a pseudo-atrium (Plan view, Fig.1).
The peristyle was trapezoidal in shape (8.29 x 9 x 16. 15 m) and was bordered by 12 columns. Four porticos, 5m wide, enclosed the garden. The semicircular pool facing the oecus-triclinium, that projected into the garden was paved with a mosaic depicting a mask of Ocean among fishes and had an inscription “NYMFARUM DOMUS” quoting a passage from Virgil’s Aeneid. According to the excavator, J.-P. Darmon, a row of broken amphoras that had served as planting pots were found along the central axis of the garden facing the oecus and the basin (Fig.2)

      <description>Province Africa Proconsularis Africa proconsularis (Pleiades)
Province Description The history of Roman Africa begins in 146 BC with the destruction of Carthage and the establishment of the province of Africa in the most fertile part of the Carthaginian Empire. The new province covered about 5000 square miles (17,172 square kilometers) of the northern part of modern Tunisia. A praetor governed the area from his headquarters at Utica. The Romans inherited a thriving agriculture developed by the Carthaginians. The climate was hospitable. Wheat and barley were the most important cereals; wine and olive oil were also produced and there were various fruit trees.
Location Sufetula
Sufetula (Pleiades)
Location Description Sufetula founded under Vespasian was a center of oil production. Excavations have shown that the city was laid out on a grid plan that was not strictly followed. Numerous buildings have been uncovered among them the forum, the capitol, the triumphal gateway dedicated to Antonius Pius, a triumphal arc of the Tetrarchy, the Great baths, the theater and the episcopal group that comprised two large basilicas called Vitalis and Bellator, which are separated from each other by the Jucundus Chapel. Annexes, among them, small baths and probably the dwellings of the clergy, surround this complex.

Pupput (Pleiades)
Location Description Pupput is located about three km to the northwest of Hammamed. Two inscriptions inform the designated title of the city, which became a colony (Colonia Aurelia Commoda Pia Felix Augusta Pupput) under the reign of Commodus. The city benefited from a strategic location at the crossroads linking Clupea to Thhuburbo and Carthage to Hadrumetum. Large residential quarters with houses and baths were excavated as well as a large necropolis.
Garden House of the Viridarium (Maison du viridarium à niches)
Keywords  peristyles (columnades) peristyles (Roman courtyards) mosaics (visual works)  Garden Description The house was located in the W neighborhood of the ancient city of Pupput and in present day lies in the precinct of a hotel, the construction of which badly damaged the house (Plan view, Fig.1).
The house has had three phases. During the second phase the garden peristyle (V) was bounded by a low wall that curved to make eight to nine semi circular niches (A, C, D, E, F, G, H, I) facing the galleries of the peristyle. The niches were paved with mosaics some of which figure birds among cut branches (D) and marine scenes (A, I). The second phase of the house is dated from the second half of the IV century.

Location Description The site is located on the East seaside of Tunisia. Excavations in the sixties have brought to light warehouses and a large domus opening towards the sea.
Garden House of two peristyles (Maison aux deux péristyles)
Keywords  peristyles (columnades) peristyles (Roman courtyards) porticoes  Garden Description This large house (850 to 900m2) was built on the sea front and was laid out around a peristyle garden. The eastern part of the domus was destroyed by the sea; the western portico is complete, only a part of the north and south porticoes of the peristyle have survived. The peristyle was approximately 200 m2 and its porticoes were separated from the garden by a low wall to which a basin was later added.
The house has known some modifications, one of which was the construction of a private bath that may have had a peristyle garden. The house was occupied between the second and the fourth centuries.
When the house was transformed into a church during the middle of the IVth century the garden of the peristyle may have been maintained.

Location Mactaris
Mactaris (Pleiades)
Location Description The city of Mactaris that had belonged to the kingdom of the Massylii was elevated to the rank of colony under Marcus Aurelius. The city was located on an important road between the steppes of the south and the rich plains of the north. The site occupies a plateau, which rises nine hundred meters above the valley of the Wadi Saboun in the central massif of the High Tell.
Archaeological investigations brought to light the amphitheater, two forums, the temple of Liber Pater, on which was erected a Christian church, and the Neo-Punic sanctuary converted into a Christian building. Also found were the temples of Apollo and Diana, several public baths that have not been completely excavated among them the great baths to the southeast and their palestra, and the northern baths. Along the periphery of the site a pyramidal mausoleum and the mausoleum of the Julii were discovered, both built on a grand scale.
Garden House of Venus (Maison de Venus)
Keywords  mosaics (visual works) porticoes basins (vessels) triclinia  Garden Description This richly decorated house is located to the east of the forum. A portico on four sides enclosed a court (ca 6.6x11.5m) that may have been planted in the early period of the house (Plan view, Fig.1, 2). An oecus-triclinium with the famous fish mosaics opened off the north side of the portico. A large rectangular basin (4.67x2.93 m) oriented northeast-southwest was placed on the axis of the triclinium, which opened on the north side of the portico. A semicircular basin was attached to the large basin on the side facing the triclinium, but the two basins do not appear to be connected. Both basins were built above ground. The base of the large basin was found in situ; the sides consisted of six monolithic pillars (5 of which were found), into which were fitted six limestone plaques (only one was found) 1.63m high, and carved with trellis designs.

Figured mosaics found in the nineteenth century are now lost. Partial excavations around 1965 disclosed a villa built around a central peristyle (14 x 10 m) with a garden in the center. A rill pool ran around the outside of the garden. On each side there was a fountain and semicircular extension of the pool into the planting area of the garden.

Arelate (Pleiades)
Location Description Arles was one of the pilgrimage sites on route to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. French pilgrimage routes to Compostela tend to follow old Roman roads, many of which continued to be utilized as primary roads of communication during the Middle Ages. Arles was a leading city of the west Roman Empire. It fell under Visigoth control during the 6th century and then under Muslims rule in 730. It has a Roman arena dating to the 1st century BCE, which is presently used for bullfights and plays. It also has many Roman ruins. Arles was home to Vincent van Gogh during a productive period of his career.

Excavations in 1982-1984, partially uncovered the remains of the building of about 240 square meters. Almost all of the fourteen known rooms of this rich house have mosaic or opus sectile floors. The house revealed by the excavations was built about 180 CE, but three prior phases, from the first and second century, were noted. It was occupied until about 260 and underwent repairs visible in restorations of the mosaics. The free space north of rooms [1], [2] and [9] was probably a garden without porticoes. How far it extended to the north and east is not known.

Location Baelo Claudia
Baelo Claudia (Pleiades)
Location Description Baelo Claudia began in the late second century BC as a center for trade with North Africa through Tangier and for salting fish and production of garum, or fish sauces. Baelo&amp;rsquo;s high point was reached about the time of Claudius, when it was made a municipium. An earthquake in the second century AD hastened its decline, though there was some revival in the third century, until it was totally abandoned by the seventh century AD. Nowhere else in the Iberian peninsula is it possible to find all the elements of Roman urbanism in such good condition: forum, temples of the capitol to the traditional gods of the Romans, a temple to an oriental divinity (in this case, Isis), curia, administrative buildings, market, theater, baths, aqueducts, private houses, an industrial zone, and a complete city wall. Only an arena seems missing.
The two private houses where there may have been gardens are near the port and are right next to the fish processing establishments – but upwind of them. They were excavated and documented in the early 1920&amp;rsquo;s by P. Paris and each occupy some 500 square meters. They faced each other with a street with porticoes on both sides between them. Both were two-story houses organized around a central peristyle courtyard. In the first, House 1 or West house, it seems highly probable that there was a garden. In the second, the House of the Sundial, one source may be read to imply that the center of the peristyle was paved in opus signinum and thus could not be a garden. Another reading of the same passage, however, puts the opus signinum only on the gutters around the perimeter of the courtyard.
Garden House No. 1 or West House
Keywords  colonnades courtyards peristyles (columnades)  Garden Description The entrance [Fig. 1, 2] to this house was on the west side of the colonnaded street. Just to the north was a shop [23] selling fish and garum; its tanks are still in place. The entrance hall leads into the west gallery of the peristyle courtyard [25]. There are three columns on each side of the courtyard. Each column’s base featured an ornamental double torus. Three capitals have been preserved; they were of the Doric order but were only rough-hewn as they, like all columns in Baelo, were covered with plaster. A garden most likely surrounded the well in the center. Rooms [32] and [33] were probably the reception room and the triclinium respectively. The reception room had a good view of the garden though not central. The northwest corner of the house belonged instead to the garum factory [VI].

This house had a rectangular peristyle courtyard with four columns on the long side and three on the shorter side, gutters around the edges, and a well in the center. According to Sillières, the courtyard was paved in opus signinum and thus did not have a garden, though potted plants may have given the appearance of a garden. Room [19] on the northeast corner of the peristyle was connected to the fish preserving operation just to the north. Perhaps the occupant of the house ran the fish business.

An unusual aspect of this site is that the planting pits for trees shading the villa were found clearly defined in the hard earth and rock around it. Each is about one meter in diameter and a meter deep. They are indicated by the green symbols in Figure 1. There was also a large water reservoir that caught the water which had been used for aesthetic effect in the central part of the house and saved it to be used to irrigate the gardens and orchards which presumably extended down the hill to the northeast of the house and between the two rows of trees. The archaeologists working on the site regretted that time and resources were lacking to explore this area with the techniques of garden archaeology.
The villa maintained a decidedly agricultural character through four phases. The most highly developed was the third phase, which is the one now represented in the ruins. The striking feature of this third phase is the dramatic entry and use of water. There are numerous springs in the karst formations higher on the hill, and from them the water was gathered into a rectangular tank, visible at the top of Figure 4 and shaded dark blue in Figure 3. At the forward edge of the tank was a small structure with a column of local marble on either side. From the tank, the water rushed down over an inclined surface lined with white marble tiles. At the base of the incline, the water was caught in a trough and guided to the center, where a lead pipe took it down, under the floor of the room below, under a somewhat more than semicircular stibadium and up into a circular basin in the center of front of the stibadium. This basin was, in fact, double, like a circular pan sitting in a larger circular sink. The overflow from the inner basin was caught in the outer basin and led, in part, by a lead pipe to the pool (space X in Figure 2) in the middle of the peristyle courtyard (space XI). A larger part of the water from the basin in the stibadium went to the reservoir (space XV), which then supplied irrigated the presumed gardens on the slope below. The pressure from the water in the trough at the base of the incline kept the water bubbling into the basin in the stibadium. In this villa, the stibadium replaced the triclinium, and the diners reclined with their heads towards the center. This particular stibadium was made of bricks covered in opus signinum. The rest of the room XVII must have been occupied by sculpture, including a copy of a Hermaphrodite statue, and possibly potted plants.
The exterior of the low walls between the eight columns of the peristyle were painted with floral designs. By this third phase of the villa, the center of the peristyle was covered in mosaic. The excavators, however, described the peristyle court as an area where vegetation must have been abundant. The attention to water and to nature in the decoration calls for plants; and the use of planters could have made the center of the peristyle seem like a garden, though no planters were found.
The chronology of the house is quite tentative. A first phase, probably to be placed in Flavian times, was an agricultural establishment with a central courtyard. The second phase added a peristyle to this courtyard and paved its center with mosaics. There may have been a pool in the peristyle. This phase probably lasted through most of the 2nd and perhaps well into the 3rd century. The elaborate nymphaeum and stibadium described above were then created either in the late 3rd or more probably early 4th century. It met a violent end with intentional destruction of the statues early in the 5th century. Later in that century, some industrial structures, including a kiln for structural ceramics, were built on the site.

      <description>Province Asia Asia (Pleiades)
Province description The region of what is now modern Turkey became a part of the Roman Empire in 133 B.C. when king Attalos III of Pergamum bequeathed his kingdom to the Roman people. The province included the heartland of the Pergamene kingdom as well as the territories of Mysia, Lydia, Ionia, Caria, western Phrygia and the eastern Aegean islands. Under Augustus in 27 B.C. Asia was declared a senatorial province and the governance of a proconsul. The capital of the province was Ephesos, although Pergamon may have fulfilled this role initially. Under Diocletian (284-305 A.D.) the province was subdivided into smaller administrative units: Hellespontus, Asia, Lydia, Caria, Phrygia I and Phrygia II. Due to its excellent harbors on the west coast and its many navigable rivers, Asia’s water-borne trade with the rest of the Mediterranean flourished. In the second century A.D. Asia experienced great prosperity, to which the growth and architectural aggrandizement of many of its cities attest. In the area of Kibyra, bordering the regions of Lycia, Caria, Phrygia and Pisidia, numerous inscriptions refer to the large imperial estates of Roman families. Woolen textiles, marble, and timber constituted a significant part of the commodities exported from the province.
While the Romans might have looked to the Greeks for inspiration in philosophy, architecture, sculpture, and the fine arts, the non-Greek peoples of the eastern Mediterranean are their inspiration for luxury, fine-living, and the status conferred by displays of individual wealth (Athenaeus Deip. XV.690). Asia was a center for such splendor, first in the kingdoms of Lydia, Phrygia, and Lycia, and then continued by the Persian satraps, and later the Hellenistic kings. The Persian paradeisos is particularly well-attested in literature referencing Asia. That these gardens are known primarily from Roman-period literary sources indicates their continuing influence. For example, long after the gold of Lydia’s Pactolus River had disappeared, Lydia remained a literary topos, not only for copious wealth, but for a life of luxury set in a landscape of natural abundance. Athenaeus (Deipnosophistae 12.515d-f) wrote in the second century A.D. that
&amp;ldquo;The Lydians in their luxury planned parks and made them like gardens and so kept in the shade. For they thought it more dainty not to have the sun’s rays touch them at all…&amp;rdquo;
Other districts of Asia captured the Roman imagination: Pliny the Elder writes of an ancient plane tree (Sycamorus orientalis) in Lycia with a girth of sufficient circumference to house a grotto in its hollow trunk, ornamented with pumice and moss with provisions for 18 people to dine there (Pliny HN 12.9).
The paradeisoi of the Persian satraps are of particular influence on the introduction of horti and gardens of Rome. The paradeisos, from the Persian, paira daeza, or “enclosed place,” is a term that had evolved by the Hellenistic period to mean a large enclosed park with luxurious gardens as well as orchards, collections of trees, crops, and hunting areas (see Sardis below). It was at Sardis that the Greek Lysander visited Cyrus the Younger, a visit recorded by Clearchus and retold by Xenophon. It is an essential moment in garden history recounted for the Romans by Cicero, De Senectute. 17.59. These paradeisoi, in the sense of luxurious orchards, are said by the Romans to have been brought to Greece by Kimon (Aristot. apud Plut. Cim. 10; comp. Cic. de Off. 2.18Plutarch), and were adopted by Hellenistic kings throughout Greece and southern Italy during the late Hellenistic period. The hunting parks at Daskyleion and Celenae are also vividly described by Xenophon (See Anabasis 1.2.7, 2.4.14 and Oeconomicus 4.13). Xenophon also describes how paradeisoi were occupied or cut down by armies during the fourth and third centuries BC. Appreciation for these parks apparently continued, and Seleucus of Syria took over the royal paradeisos at Sardis (Plutarch, Demetrios 50.6). Years of instability followed, so it is difficult to know what the Romans themselves thought of paradeisoi in Asia in the second and first centuries B.C. Notable examples of paradeisoi, in some form, may have been visible to Romans visiting Asia, as well. For example, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus is now thought by its excavators to have been set in a grove or park.
Thus, the paradeisos, the alsos, the gymnasium, and the quadriporticus are not forms the Romans suddenly “discovered.” They had had a long influence and were integrated into the Hellenistic architectural forms of the Italic landscape. In the second century B.C., however, when the Roman generals began to define themselves as rulers of an empire, they turned directly to the palaces and paradeisoi of the Hellenistic monarchs to establish their power, to display spoils of war, and to create the luxurious setting for life in Rome. They further adapted the evolving quadriporticus form for display to the public Despite the importance of Asia Minor in the history of the Roman landscape, archaeological evidence is scant. The excavators contacted for this essay indicated that parks, gardens, and other planted areas have yet to become a subject of research design for the region and finds appear to be few—primarily inscriptions and wall paintings. Most of the smaller domestic courtyards—often the most manageable to investigate - are paved. The larger palaestrae, gymnasia, and enclosed open spaces have not been investigated for landscape architectural and planting features, although recently an important campaign of work in the South Agora at Aphrodisias is setting an important precedent (see below). This catalog includes areas with dirt and incomplete paved surfaces, and notes sites where the excavators have some level of optimism about fruitful future study. The subject of designed landscapes, gardens, and planted areas in Asia Minor awaits archaeological investigation.
Location DIDYMA (Didim, Turkey) (Pleiades)
Garden Temple Grove of Apollo
Keywords  sacred grove sanctuary  Garden Description The sanctuary of Apollo at Didyma was a regional sanctuary that lay on the border of Caria and Ionia (Strabo 12.1.2). The Temple of Apollo, attested by Strabo (12.1.5), was built on the site of the spring and oracle of Apollo mentioned by Herodotus (1.92.159) and Pausanius (7.2.6). Inscriptions found in the area of the sanctuary attest to a “sacred grove” [(CIG 2885d)] and Strabo (14.1.5) specifies that in his day a grove (alsos) was planted inside and outside the temple precinct.
The precinct has been well-defined archaeologically, but the archaeologists identified no traces of the trees.

Andalusia (Pleiades), Ciudad Real and Badajoz (Pleiades). Outstanding in this region was its mineral wealth with several important areas such as Castulo (Pleiades) the Guadalquivir River and the territory supplied Rome with oil for the annona (a tax paid with foodstuffs for the army), as shown by the number of amphorae of Dressel 20 type found in the Testaccio (Pleiades) hill in Rome. But not only olives grew in Baetica (Pleiades) ; artichokes, mentioned by Pliny HN 19.152. as cultivated near Cordoba, or or the figs referred to by Columella RR 11.2. 59-60 are among other crops from Baetica. The ceteriae, fish factories, were another source of wealth, as seen in the economic bases of the city of Baelo Claudia (Bolonia, Cádiz). Italica, reorganized by Hadrian in tribute to his ancestor, Trajan, who had been born there, is notable for its layout, equal in importance to the spectacular religious buildings of Munigua. Corduba, the provincial capital, is remarkable for its wealth of monuments and was decorated with marble, with outstanding iconography on its provincial forum that like the other two capitals in the peninsula, imitated the sculptural groups, clipeos and caryatides, etc, of the Forum Augustum (Pleiades) in Rome.

      <description>Province Hispania Tarraconensis
Tarraconensis(Pleiades)
Province Description In 236 BC, to offset Carthage&amp;rsquo;s loss of Sicily and Sardinia in the First Punic War, Hamilcar Barca led an expedition into Hispania to establish a colony there. Through force of arms and diplomacy, he spread Carthaginian influence as far north as Barcellona, which bears his name. In 230 BC, Hasdrubal, his son-in-law, established Qart Hadast that became Carthago Nova in Roman times and Cartagena today. After the death of Hasdrubal, Hannibal, Hamilcar&amp;rsquo;s oldest son, took command, attacked Saguntum, and in 218 set out for Italy leaving his younger brother, Hasdrubal, in command in Spain. Through the Alps, he descended into Italy and threatened Rome for fourteen years. Roman armies under the brothers Gnaeus and Publius Cornelius Scipio kept Hasdrubal in check and prevented his reinforcing Hannibal. They were both killed by the Carthaginians in 212. Two years later, another Publius Cornelius Scipio, the 25-year-old son of the late general of the same name, was sent to Spain. The next year, he captured New Carthage and, in 206 at the battle of Ilipa (about 15 km north of Savilla) destroyed most of the Carthaginians&amp;rsquo; numerically superior army and ended their hold on Spain. Scipio settled his wounded veterans nearby at a place he called Italica to remind them of their origins. Today, it is one of the best Roman archaeological sites in Italy. After a quick trip back to Rome, where he was elected consul, he returned to Spain and went on to attack Carthage itself. Hannibal was recalled to Africa, but Scipio annihilated his army in 202. Rome thus came into possession of the Mediterranean coast of Iberia.
If Rome was drawn into Hispania to keep the Carthaginians there from supporting Hannibal in Italy, it missed the opportunity offered by Hannibal&amp;rsquo;s defeat to get out of Spain honorably. Instead, in 197 BC it created two new Roman provinces, Hispania Citerior whose capital was Carthago Nova and Hispania Ulterior with Corduba as its capital. Soon after, Rome launched a long war to subjugate the Lusitani, Celtiberians on the west coast. During Sulla&amp;rsquo;s dictatorship, the Lusitani were again in revolt, this time under the able leadership of the Roman general Quintus Sertorius, who sought to create an independent, Roman-like state in Hispania. He established a senate and schools for the sons of the local nobility.
Augustus&amp;rsquo;s conquest of Hispania produced a new territorial division that replaced the earlier two-province organization of the region. Augustus divided the whole of the peninsula into three provinces: Hispania Citerior or Tarraconensis, with its capital Tarraco (Tarragona); Hispania Ulterior Baetica, with its capital Corduba (Córdoba); and Hispania Ulterior Lusitania, or Emerita Augusta, with its capital Mérida. The provinces, in turn, were subdivided in administrative legal units, or conventus. The western lands stayed part of the newly demarcated Lusitania, areas into which Romanization had hardly penetrated, in contrast to the other areas of the peninsula where the classical tradition had been incorporated quite early. This division lasted until late antiquity, when Tarraconensis was subdivided into three provinces: Tarraconensis, whose capital continued to be Tarraco (Tarragona), Carthaginiensis, with Carthago Nova (Catagena) as its capital, and Gallaecia, whose capital was Bracara Augusta (Braga, in northern Portugal).
The Mediterranean trio of wine, oil and cereals are the crops most frequently mentioned by all the classical authors when referring to the Iberian Peninsula. These were not the only plants cultivated here. Trogus Pompey, in his Universal History (44. 1-2), praises, as well as those products, the fertility of the soil itself, the benevolence of its climate, the opportune and abundant rains which enable all types of fruits to be gathered, thus supplying every need. He describes the linen and esparto grass as of the highest quality. Strabo recorded the tradition of irrigation as a common practice in pre-Roman agriculture (Strabo 3.2.5). This was continued by the Romans, as shown by the number of aqueducts, dams and small reservoirs still to be found on Spanish soil. Pliny, during his stay as procurator in Spain in the first century, gives more specific descriptions of the flora throughout his Natural History (Book XVI). Martial (Epigrams II) refers to myrtle, box and laurel, as common elements to be found in the garden of country houses in Spain.
It is not strange, therefore, that gardening, the work of the topiarius, was usual in Iberian houses, as this study shows. It was not, however, totally new to Spanish territory. Although there are no literary references to gardening in the Pre-Roman era, it must have been part of Iberian culture, as is proved in an unusual way in the northwest of the peninsula in the area under the influence of Greek culture from the city of Emporion (Ampurias or Empuriae). A Hellenic establishment there, Rhode (Rosas), in the third century BC minted drachmas with a rose as the emblem. There were sacred woods connected with the cities. Close to Augustas Emeritas was Lucus Feroniae. Dedicated to Augustus was Lucus Augusti, which gave rise to the present-day Lugo, in Galicia, and another Lucus existed in the environs of Gijón, the Lugo de Llanera (Blázquez, p. 24).
There has been little research on the gardens in the Roman settlements in Spain and Portugal. In drawing up the list of sites with gardens for this catalog, we have accepted that a garden existed when it was so labeled by the excavators. There are, however, many other probable gardens which we have included. Gorges found just under forty villas where enough remained to draw a plan. In them, certain features help to identify a garden. A peristyle alerts us to suspect a garden, but peristyle courtyards were sometimes paved with stones or bricks over a layer of lime. They were clearly not gardens. But if the courtyard had soil in it, it was in all probability a garden. Fountains, fountain statues, and pools are typical of a garden since water is indispensable for a garden. Most peristyles in Roman villas in Spain had ornamental irrigation channels, semicircular pools, wells or pools that gave the impression of still water that, nevertheless, endowed the garden with a cool humidity that favored the cultivation of plants. In Spain, peristyles with drainage are found in the first and second centuries AD and are also common in the late Empire. Certain types of statuary intimately connected with vegetation and nature are found in gardens, such as divinities related to Bacchus and his circle. At Pompeii, Diana, a garden goddess, sometimes paired with Apollo, is also found. Herms were placed on pilasters, as the examples in situ from Pompeii show. Characteristic of Roman villas was the way in which they opened out to the countryside onto a grand vista of gardens and parks filled with fountains.
The roughly triangular province of Tarraconensis, by far the largest of the three provinces of the Iberian Peninsula, stretched across the north side of modern Spain and down the east coast as far as Almeria. On the Atlantic coast, it reached as far south as present Oporto.

Garden Villa Romana de els Munts
Keywords  porticoes  Garden Description This richly adorned pleasure villa by the sea was built early in the first century AD and continued in use into the fifth century. Its period of greatest splendor was between about 100 and 250 AD. It was pillaged and burned shortly after 268, dated by a hoard of coins found in the underground prison. The prison was equipped with stocks, presumably for punishment of slaves. The mansion was rebuilt and enlarged during the fourth century AD.
Across the front of the house on the side by the sea ran a portico [1] in a northwest-to-southeast direction to offer the best view. The garden lay between this portico and the sea. The excavator judged the area to be a garden, and his view is supported by several pools and perhaps a nymphaeum in the area. Also, at its southeast end, the portico turns and runs towards the sea. Opening onto this arm was a reception room with seven octagonal fountains arranged in a U. This room thus faced the garden and a pool rather than the sea. The portico was extended by a walkway and steps which defined the edge of the garden and led down the hill to a large bath complex added in the fourth-century rebuilding.

      <description>Province Sicily
Province Description Sicily, the largest island in the Mediterranean, was colonised by Greeks from the later eighth century B. C., with Syracuse becoming the largest and most powerful Greek polis; in time most of the indigenous settlements of the interior also became profoundly Hellenized. The western tip of the island was settled by Phoenicians and later became an outpost of Carthaginian control. In the third century B. C. Sicily became embroiled in the First Punic War which resulted in Rome’s acquisition of the island as its first overseas provincia in 241 B. C.; in 211 B. C. Sicily was above all famed for its agricultural fertility and its capacity to produce exceptional grain yields (wheat and barley), and to a lesser extent wine. By the time of the Roman Empire the principal flourishing cities were located on the coast, with much of the interior given over to scattered agricultural villages, villas and farms.

      <description>Province Sicily
Province Description Sicily, the largest island in the Mediterranean, was colonised by Greeks from the later eighth century B. C., with Syracuse becoming the largest and most powerful Greek polis; in time most of the indigenous settlements of the interior also became profoundly Hellenized. The western tip of the island was settled by Phoenicians and later became an outpost of Carthaginian control. In the third century B. C. Sicily became embroiled in the First Punic War which resulted in Rome’s acquisition of the island as its first overseas provincia in 241 B. C.; in 211 B. C. Sicily was above all famed for its agricultural fertility and its capacity to produce exceptional grain yields (wheat and barley), and to a lesser extent wine. By the time of the Roman Empire the principal flourishing cities were located on the coast, with much of the interior given over to scattered agricultural villages, villas and farms.

This town house has a small rectangular pool with a small semicircular recess (Farrar Type B) at the south end of the garden peristyle, facing what was presumably the principal dining room at the south end of the house. The precise date is uncertain.

Garden PUBLIC GARDEN, Syracuse
Keywords Garden Description In the Roman period, the clearest evidence for the presence of a formal garden in a public place comes from Syracuse, where an impressive piazza, 175 by 45 meters, was laid out early in the Augustan period on the west side of the third-century B. C. Altar of Hieron (Fig. 2). A U-shaped stoa was erected on three sides, with fourteen columns on the short sides and sixty-four on the long; the Altar itself formed the fourth. Within the area enclosed by this portico, a large rectangular basin was erected in the center, with steps at the corners and a statue base in the middle; a drain led away from the basin westwards under the portico. The open space around the basin was planted systematically with five rows of trees, thirty-two trees in the two outermost rows, and twenty-six in each of the rows interrupted by the pool; there were thus 142 trees (of unknown species) in all (Fig. 3). The arrangement, with its central pool, trees and surrounding porticoes, recalls similar monuments in Campania, such as the Great Palaestra, also of Augustan date, at Pompeii (see Vol. 1, no.), and the Palaestra at Herculaneum (see Vol. 1, no.). The function of the Syracuse square is unknown, but it must have been principally intended as a pleasant park where the townsfolk of Syracuse could stroll, especially, perhaps, when attending events staged in the nearby amphitheater.

Keywords Garden Description This fourth-century villa on the north coast has also yielded evidence for a garden (but no ornamental pools). A figured mosaic pavement belonging to an earlier, third-century villa was found inside the courtyard of the later villa, but it had been heavily damaged by cuttings through it for the plants and trees of the garden of the fourth-century villa. Nothing can be said of the layout of the latter in detail as the excavation remains unpublished, but the potential for garden archaeology in the island has at least been demonstrated.

Garden Villa, in the Casale district near Piazza Armerina
Keywords Garden Description The sumptuous fourth-century villa has, not surprisingly, a large and most elaborately-shaped pool at the center of its main peristyle (Farrar Type G: Fig. ): it consists of a rectangular central basin with outward-curving recesses in the middle of the long sides, and two independent demi-lune pools (i.e. with one straight and one curved side, but enclosing overall less than a semicircle) at either end of the short sides; the whole is twenty meters long and nine meters wide (15 on Fig. 12). Its exterior was veneered in marble; the interior was mosaic-lined, with fish depicted on the edge above the water line, and plain tessellation below. Water played from a fountain at the center of the pool, where a small octagonal base was furnished with a vertical lead pipe. The demi-lune pools were wholly marble-lined. A headless marble statuette of a cupid (Fig. 13) and the legs of a second were found in the larger basin: they must have formed a matching pair of statues, set on the pedestals found at either end of the pool. The marble head of a curly-haired young man was also found in the western demi-lune basin (Fig. 14). Nothing is known of the presumed garden surrounding this elaborate pool, but marble slabs set between the columns of the peristyle to restrict access to the central area were carved with stylised dolphins (Fig. 15), and a marble table-support carved with the customary feline on its front face, which was found in the southern peristyle corridor, might also conceivably have come from the garden (Fig. 16). The elliptical court (41) in front of the three-apsed banqueting hall was also provided with two small fountains as well as an elaborate water feature with niches (a nymphaeum) at its west end, but it had no garden, as the area was mosaic-paved (unless the latter is secondary).

      <description>Province Africa proconsularis
Province Description The history of Roman Africa begins in 146 BC with the destruction of Carthage and the establishment of the province of Africa in the most fertile part of the Carthaginian Empire. The new province covered about 5000 square miles (17,172 square kilometers) of the northern part of modern Tunisia. A praetor governed the area from his headquarters at Utica. The Romans inherited a thriving agriculture developed by the Carthaginians. The climate was hospitable. Wheat and barley were the most important cereals; wine and olive oil were also produced and there were various fruit trees.
Location Althiburos (Médeïna)
Althiburos (Pleiades)
Location Description This town is located on the road between Carthage and Theveste near the border of Proconsularis and Byzacena 35 km west of Mactar. Under the Roman Empire it remained an indigenous civitas until it was raised to the status of a municipium by Hadrian: municipium aelium hadrianum augustum althiburitanum and later was granted the ius Italicum.
The trade of agricultural products and craftsmanship made Althiburos a prosperous city, particularly, the fabrication and the commerce of aromatics. The development of the city reached its peak under the Antonian and Severian dynasties. It is difficult to follow the history of Althiburos during the third century when the province of Africa underwent the severe crisis of 238. The city was abandoned just before the Arab conquest. Excavations have brought to light the forum, the capitol, the Hadrianic triumphal arch and two temples. At the east corner of the forum, near one of the temples, was a complex of houses and a building with a rotonda to the south of which stood a monumental fountain. Outside the excavated center are other monuments, among them the theater and a triumphal arch.
Garden Asclepeia Building (Edifice des Asclepeia)
Keywords Garden Description The Asklepeia monument, so-called from a mosaic inscription, is located to the northeast of the House of the Muses. (Plan view, Fig. 1)
This building is divided into three sections: the central building, the northeast sector and the private baths. The central building, probably a house, presents an architectural arrangement unusual in Africa. Strictly symmetrical in plan, the monument has a long gallery terminating at either end in two corner turrets. The facade has several windows on either side of an impressive entrance. This corridor opens onto a large square room flanked on either side by a square-shaped basin with a passageway running around it. This great vestibule views onto a peristyle garden (20.33x17.5m) equipped with a complete hydraulic system in the garden (167m2). Two large symmetrical oeci, along with their adjoining apartments, frame both sides of this peristyle. The garden gradually changed during three phases of building renovation.
During the first phase, in the beginning of the third century, the garden was bordered by twenty columns and had a well (f) and two square shaped enclosures (e, h) from which water jets came out. One jetted towards the reception room (4) located near the entrance on the south and the other jetted symmetrically towards the reception room (23) on the north.
During the second phase, in the mid third century, the garden was enclosed by a balustrade and several water features were added: two semi-circular basins (c, d) symmetrical in shape and size – with a rectangular shape on the outside and semi-circular on the inside, each facing a reception room (28, 16). A shallow round pool that had the shape of a daisy with 49 petals was placed inside the N square enclosure (h) from which water was jetting. The well was later filled with soil and not used.
During this phase, a long rectangular basin was laid in front of the entrance of the house. The basin may have been bordered by a garden.
During the third stage dated to the beginning of the second half of the fourth century, the water features were modified and a large basin was added. Niches were added inside the semi-circular basins. In the center of the garden, a rectangular basin (g) (6.20x4.20m) that protruded onto the square basin (h) and enclosed a small rectangular basin (g) (0.15x0.15m) was added.

      <description>Province Africa proconsularis
Province Description The history of Roman Africa begins in 146 BC with the destruction of Carthage and the establishment of the province of Africa in the most fertile part of the Carthaginian Empire. The new province covered about 5000 square miles (17,172 square kilometers) of the northern part of modern Tunisia. A praetor governed the area from his headquarters at Utica. The Romans inherited a thriving agriculture developed by the Carthaginians. The climate was hospitable. Wheat and barley were the most important cereals; wine and olive oil were also produced and there were various fruit trees.

Location Hadrumetum (Sousse)
Hadrumetum (Pleiades)
Location Description Hadrumetum is located on the bay of Hammamet at the edge of the fertile region of Sahel from which it drew its wealth. Choosing the side of Rome against Carthage during the Punic war, Hadrumetum was rewarded with the status of free town. Taking the side of Pompey, the city was heavily fined by Caesar after his victory at Thapsus. Nevertheless, the opulence of its houses adorned with luxurious mosaics testifies that the city experienced great economic development after its elevation to the status of colony, under Trajan.
Garden House of Sorothus (Maison de Sorothus)
Keywords Garden Description This very damaged house was laid out around a peristyle garden. A semi-circular and bisected basin was placed on the axis of the reception room (Pan view, Fig. 1). The small wall that enclosed the garden was painted with flowers.

Location Acholla (Henchir Botria)
Acholla (Pleiades)
Location Description The city of Acholla was established forty-five km north of Sfax, along the seashore of the coast of Bysacena. When the city took sides with Rome in the third Punic war, Acholla was rewarded with the status of a free city. Later, under Hadrian, the city became a municipum. Production of oil from the countryside, inner cities of Bararus and Thysdrus, and commerce by sea made Acholla, with its harbor, a prosperous town. Two baths and a series of houses testify to the wealth of the inhabitants of Acholla by the opulence and the originality of their mosaic décor. The mosaic decor gives evidence to the presence of one of the first mosaic workshops in Africa.
Garden House of Asinus Rufinus (Maison d&amp;rsquo;Asinus Rufinus)
Keywords Garden Description The house of Asinus Rufinus (900m2) is located in the center of the city. Towards the south its façade extends along an open area partially excavated and is interpreted as the possible forum of the city. The house contains a mosaic pavement of Hercules and an inscription located in the main entrance hall with the honorific cursus of M. Asinus Rufinus, who was consul between 184 and 185. Rufinus most likely changed the older house (from Tiberian times) to this new one opened towards the South. Therefore the data attributed to this phase of the house comes from the second half of the II century AD, during the reign of Commodus.
The house’s incomplete excavation (Plan view, Fig. 1) includes a small entrance and several shops opening onto a non-excavated street oriented towards the North. The various rooms of the house were laid out around a complete peristyle: the triclinium and two apartments in the south, an apartment on the east, two unpaved spaces on the north and a lararium on the northwest. A staircase indicates that the house had an upper level.
The low wall of four porticos spanned the viridarium of the peristyle (13.65 x 10.70 m), which curves to form an apse in front of the triclinium (IV) located on the south. In the viridarium there was a cistern. Access to the viridarium and cistern was provided under the north portico, between the 6th and 7th column. If the low wall had been stuccoed and painted as the columns were, there are currently no traces of painting on the viridarium side of it. Mortar channels along the north and the west of the garden collected the water from the roof and brought it to one of the cisterns located in the southwest corner of the garden. The soil of the garden has not been examined.
Adjacent to the east apartment is a light well with an earthen floor, which can be regarded as a small garden (IX). A large window in room VIII opened into this garden (IX).

Garden House of the Bust of Marcus Aurelius (Maison du Buste de Marc Aurèle)
Keywords Garden Description This domus (ca. 1000 m²) has a large central garden (250 m²) enclosed by a peristyle (20.20 x 21.40 m, 432.30 m²) (Plan view, Fig. 1). The northwest wing seems the most important area of the house. It had a large corridor that opened onto a portico with a view toward the garden. In the garden, along the axis of the main reception room, a semi-circular aedicula was installed on a cistern where fragments of Marcus Aurelius bust were found. On the south side of the garden was a semi-circular pool.
The wing that is perpendicular to the northwest one was comprised of a series of rooms built against the hill. All rooms were paved with mosaics and belonged to a latter phase. Rooms located on the higher level beyond this wing had a large panoramic view of the sea.

      <description>Province Africa proconsularis
Province Description The history of Roman Africa begins in 146 BC with the destruction of Carthage and the establishment of the province of Africa in the most fertile part of the Carthaginian Empire. The new province covered about 5000 square miles (17,172 square kilometers) of the northern part of modern Tunisia. A praetor governed the area from his headquarters at Utica. The Romans inherited a thriving agriculture developed by the Carthaginians. The climate was hospitable. Wheat and barley were the most important cereals; wine and olive oil were also produced and there were various fruit trees.
Location Althiburos (Médeïna)
Althiburos (Pleiades)
Location Description This town is located on the road between Carthage and Theveste near the border of Proconsularis and Byzacena 35 km west of Mactar. Under the Roman Empire it remained an indigenous civitas until it was raised to the status of a municipium by Hadrian: municipium aelium hadrianum augustum althiburitanum and later was granted the ius Italicum.
The trade of agricultural products and craftsmanship made Althiburos a prosperous city, particularly, the fabrication and the commerce of aromatics. The development of the city reached its peak under the Antonian and Severian dynasties. It is difficult to follow the history of Althiburos during the third century when the province of Africa underwent the severe crisis of 238. The city was abandoned just before the Arab conquest. Excavations have brought to light the forum, the capitol, the Hadrianic triumphal arch and two temples. At the east corner of the forum, near one of the temples, was a complex of houses and a building with a rotonda to the south of which stood a monumental fountain. Outside the excavated center are other monuments, among them the theater and a triumphal arch.

Choosing the side of Rome against Carthage during the Punic war, Hadrumetum was rewarded with the status of free town. Taking the side of Pompey, the city was heavily fined by Caesar after his victory at Thapsus.

Location Acholla (Henchir Botria)
Acholla (Pleiades)
Location Description The city of Acholla was established forty-five km north of Sfax, along the seashore of the coast of Bysacena. When the city took sides with Rome in the third Punic war, Acholla was rewarded with the status of a free city. Later, under Hadrian, the city became a municipum. Production of oil from the countryside, inner cities of Bararus and Thysdrus, and commerce by sea made Acholla, with its harbor, a prosperous town. Two baths and a series of houses testify to the wealth of the inhabitants of Acholla by the opulence and the originality of their mosaic décor. The mosaic decor gives evidence to the presence of one of the first mosaic workshops in Africa.
Garden House of the Triumph of Neptune (Maison du Triomphe de Neptune)
Keywords Garden Description The fully excavated House of the Triumph of Neptune (1172 m2) is situated in the northern part of the city. The house has a complete peristyle with one aisle entrance situated indirectly from the northeast (Plan view, Fig. 1). Opposite the entry, the western wing of the house is organized with a vast colonnaded oecus-triclinium in the center. On both sides of the oecus-triclinium there are two apartments with four rooms each and a passage to a non-paved rectangular court. There is another triclinium on the south side of the peristyle and a reception room opening onto the north portico.
A low wall encloses the peristyle (17.50 x 14.50 m) with its garden (VII; 11.40 x 9.10 m). The low wall curves to form three apses facing the tripartite entry of the oecus-triclinium. The preserved walls of the garden show the level of the soil at ca. 0.65 m, which is under the level of the porticos’ mosaics. On those walls, there were small remains of paintings depicting a fence with touches of green foliage on black or brown. It was probably a garden view. A small basin was placed later in the northeast corner.
Two open spaces with an earthen floor, probably small gardens, were arranged in both apartments and were accessible by a passage. It is possible that the north and south walls of the oecus-triclinium might have had a window opening onto these courtyard gardens.
Another possible garden was adjacent to the reception room of the northern aisle of the portico. This house dates from 150-170 A.D.

The new province covered about 5000 square miles (17,172 square kilometers) of the northern part of modern Tunisia. A praetor governed the area from his headquarters at Utica. The Romans inherited a thriving agriculture developed by the Carthaginians. The climate was hospitable. Wheat and barley were the most important cereals; wine and olive oil were also produced and there were various fruit trees.
Location Acholla (Henchir Botria)
Acholla (Pleiades)
Location Description The city of Acholla was established forty-five km north of Sfax, along the seashore of the coast of Bysacena. When the city took sides with Rome in the third Punic war, Acholla was rewarded with the status of a free city. Later, under Hadrian, the city became a municipum. Production of oil from the countryside, inner cities of Bararus and Thysdrus, and commerce by sea made Acholla, with its harbor, a prosperous town. Two baths and a series of houses testify to the wealth of the inhabitants of Acholla by the opulence and the originality of their mosaic décor. The mosaic decor gives evidence to the presence of one of the first mosaic workshops in Africa.
Garden House of the Triumph of Neptune (Maison du Triomphe de Neptune)
Keywords Garden Description The fully excavated House of the Triumph of Neptune (1172 m2) is situated in the northern part of the city. The house has a complete peristyle with one aisle entrance situated indirectly from the northeast (Plan view, Fig. 1). Opposite the entry, the western wing of the house is organized with a vast colonnaded oecus-triclinium in the center. On both sides of the oecus-triclinium there are two apartments with four rooms each and a passage to a non-paved rectangular court. There is another triclinium on the south side of the peristyle and a reception room opening onto the north portico.
A low wall encloses the peristyle (17.50 x 14.50 m) with its garden (VII; 11.40 x 9.10 m). The low wall curves to form three apses facing the tripartite entry of the oecus-triclinium. The preserved walls of the garden show the level of the soil at ca. 0.65 m, which is under the level of the porticos’ mosaics. On those walls, there were small remains of paintings depicting a fence with touches of green foliage on black or brown. It was probably a garden view. A small basin was placed later in the northeast corner.
Two open spaces with an earthen floor, probably small gardens, were arranged in both apartments and were accessible by a passage. It is possible that the north and south walls of the oecus-triclinium might have had a window opening onto these courtyard gardens.
Another possible garden was adjacent to the reception room of the northern aisle of the portico. This house dates from 150-170 A.D.

Mauretania Tingitana (province)(Pleiades)
Province Description An ancient district of Africa in Roman times, Mauretania lay west of Numidia and covered most of present-day Morocco and western Algeria. By the second century BCE, when Jugurtha of Numidia was rebelling against Rome, Jugurtha’s father-in-law Bocchus had most of Mauretania under his control. In 25 BCE Augustus appointed Juba II as ruler of Mauretania. Claudius divided it into two provinces: Mauretania Caesariensis, with Caesarea (modern Cherchel) as capital, and Mauretania Tingitana, with Tingis (modern Tangier) as capital. By the end of the 5th century CE, the province had disappeared.
Location Volubilis Volubilis (Pleiades)
Location Description Volubilis was the capital of the province of Mauretania Tingitania. The city was of Punic foundation, located on the edge of a plain that slopes down from the Zerhoun hills. During the reign of Juba II, king of Mauretania, Volubilis knew a prosperous period. He was succeeded by his son, Ptolemy of Mauretania, who was assassinated in 40 CE by Caligula. The kingdom was then divided into two provinces, and Volubilis was elevated to the rank of municipium as a reward for taking the side of Rome during the conflict.
The city rapidly developed and expanded; new temples, baths, civic buildings and luxurious houses lining the porticoed decumanus maximus were built. The olive press and the mills attached to the houses attest to the rural character of the region. The city reached its climax in the beginning of the third century CE and survives today as a well-preserved archaeological site. The city walls and gates, Caracalla’s triumphal arch, the Capitolium temple, and the Basilica law courts survive. A number of houses known for their floor mosaics and bronze sculpture also persist to the modern day.

The peristyle had a trapezoidal shape and was enclosed on four sides by a portico supported by 12 columns. The space between the columns was spanned by a low wall. The peristyle is of Rhodian type with higher columns along the side of the oecus that opened into it. In the center of the garden, set slightly closer to the oecus, was an elaborate pool made of recesses that enclosed a masonry fountain ornamented with rectilinear and curved niches. Five reception rooms opened into the garden, among which is the triclinium 5 with its pavement mosaic featuring the Labors of Hercules.

Lusitania(Pleiades)
Province Description Despite the prior existence of urban centers like Metellinum, the capital of Lusitania was a new foundation, the Colonia Augusta Emerita (Mérida), which would also serve as the capital of one of the smaller juridical units (conventus) and would be the scene of flourishing activity in the succeeding centuries, its prosperity lasting until the late Roman and Visigothic era. Subsequently, a series of well-known Roman cities were built in what was then Lusitania but is now partly in Portugal and partly in Spain. As well as the capital, there were Conimbriga, Salmantica, Evora, Olisipo (now Lisbon), Pax Iulia (now Beja), and Metallium Viscascense (Aljustrel), this last recognized as the capital of an important mining area. The series of wealthy villae, such as that of La Cocosa, Milreu or San Cucufate are particularly noteworthy. Another of the important elements of the Roman era is the series of still visible ways of communication, of which the Vía de la Plata has most remaining, especially in the sections of Baños de Montemayor in Cáceres or the bridges that cross the rivers, such as that of San Pedro de Alcántara, or of Mérida.
Location Emerita Augusta
Emerita Augusta (Pleiades)
Location Description Geopolitical and economic motives together facilitated the prosperity of this great center of the Iberian peninsula. Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, son-in-law of the emperor, was a benefactor of Augusta Emerita. The city was situated on the right bank of the Anas River (Rio Guardiana), today the Guadiana River. The site had the advantage of an easily crossed ford at the mouth of the Barraeca River (Rio Albarregas), and was an ideal site for surveillance and defense. The area immediately surrounding Augusta Emerita had rich granite quarries, sands from the riverbed, and other types of rock for the new constructions. The city’s topography determined the new rectilinear urban layout. The variations in ground level, due to small hills in the land, probably necessitated terracing, which is still discernible in today’s modern network of streets. The bridge over the Guadiana, the longest in the peninsula with a length of almost 800 meters, provided the N-S axis to which the street grid was aligned. The new colony also had an ambitious system of urban drainage. The sewers and water lines form a complete underground complex of canals. The works of hydraulic engineering, whose dates of construction and later stages of development are debated, support the notion that Augusta Emerita was a city with a grand, forward-looking vision.
At the intersection of the decumanus and cardo were two fora, one for the city&amp;rsquo;s functions and one for the Province&amp;rsquo;s functions. Some of the monumental buildings have been excavated. The Mérida fora, whose layouts resemble those in the other western imperial provinces, have iconographic programs that resemble those of Rome; the forum of Augusta Emerita is a particularly faithful reflection of the Forum Augustum. This imitative trend appears also in the two other provincial capitals of Hispania, Tarraco and Corduba and underscores the power which Augustan images and architecture had in the political, ideological fabric of the provinces.
The area of Augusta Emerita best known today, because of extensive excavations, is around the so-called Temple of Diana. The temple is actually dedicated to the imperial cult. The structures devoted to public performance - theater, amphitheater, and circus - surrounded the urban center. The theater was begun in 16-15 BC and the amphitheater in 8 BC, during the first decades of colonial presence. Augusta Emerita’s necropolis ran around the city’s urban perimeter and expanded as the city proper grew.
Because most of evidence from Merida was unearthed in old excavations, the context of many ancient objects is unknown. There is also a lack of analytical data on many of the areas which must originally have been gardened. The classification of the gardens of the Colonia Augusta Emerita is still under analysis. The study by Moreno is a basic survey article and should be understood to be part of all the bibliographies for Merida.

These include a colonnaded courtyard with columns on small white marble bases, three each on the north and south sides and two each on the east and west sides, not counting those on the corners. In the northeast corner of the courtyard was a shallow pool resembling an impluvium. It was shifted off-center in the garden to be almost on the axis of the larger of the two apses. A rill, coated in opus signinum, ran along its north, south and west sides. In the center was a cistern capped by a wellhead made of marble slabs and lined with several layers of opus signinum.

      <description>Province Hispania Tarraconensis
Tarraconensis(Pleiades)
Province Description In 236 BC, to offset Carthage&amp;rsquo;s loss of Sicily and Sardinia in the First Punic War, Hamilcar Barca led an expedition into Hispania to establish a colony there. Through force of arms and diplomacy, he spread Carthaginian influence as far north as Barcellona, which bears his name. In 230 BC, Hasdrubal, his son-in-law, established Qart Hadast that became Carthago Nova in Roman times and Cartagena today. After the death of Hasdrubal, Hannibal, Hamilcar&amp;rsquo;s oldest son, took command, attacked Saguntum, and in 218 set out for Italy leaving his younger brother, Hasdrubal, in command in Spain. Through the Alps, he descended into Italy and threatened Rome for fourteen years. Roman armies under the brothers Gnaeus and Publius Cornelius Scipio kept Hasdrubal in check and prevented his reinforcing Hannibal. They were both killed by the Carthaginians in 212. Two years later, another Publius Cornelius Scipio, the 25-year-old son of the late general of the same name, was sent to Spain. The next year, he captured New Carthage and, in 206 at the battle of Ilipa (about 15 km north of Savilla) destroyed most of the Carthaginians&amp;rsquo; numerically superior army and ended their hold on Spain. Scipio settled his wounded veterans nearby at a place he called Italica to remind them of their origins. Today, it is one of the best Roman archaeological sites in Italy. After a quick trip back to Rome, where he was elected consul, he returned to Spain and went on to attack Carthage itself. Hannibal was recalled to Africa, but Scipio annihilated his army in 202. Rome thus came into possession of the Mediterranean coast of Iberia.
If Rome was drawn into Hispania to keep the Carthaginians there from supporting Hannibal in Italy, it missed the opportunity offered by Hannibal&amp;rsquo;s defeat to get out of Spain honorably. Instead, in 197 BC it created two new Roman provinces, Hispania Citerior whose capital was Carthago Nova and Hispania Ulterior with Corduba as its capital. Soon after, Rome launched a long war to subjugate the Lusitani, Celtiberians on the west coast. During Sulla&amp;rsquo;s dictatorship, the Lusitani were again in revolt, this time under the able leadership of the Roman general Quintus Sertorius, who sought to create an independent, Roman-like state in Hispania. He established a senate and schools for the sons of the local nobility.
Augustus&amp;rsquo;s conquest of Hispania produced a new territorial division that replaced the earlier two-province organization of the region. Augustus divided the whole of the peninsula into three provinces: Hispania Citerior or Tarraconensis, with its capital Tarraco (Tarragona); Hispania Ulterior Baetica, with its capital Corduba (Córdoba); and Hispania Ulterior Lusitania, or Emerita Augusta, with its capital Mérida. The provinces, in turn, were subdivided in administrative legal units, or conventus. The western lands stayed part of the newly demarcated Lusitania, areas into which Romanization had hardly penetrated, in contrast to the other areas of the peninsula where the classical tradition had been incorporated quite early. This division lasted until late antiquity, when Tarraconensis was subdivided into three provinces: Tarraconensis, whose capital continued to be Tarraco (Tarragona), Carthaginiensis, with Carthago Nova (Catagena) as its capital, and Gallaecia, whose capital was Bracara Augusta (Braga, in northern Portugal).
The Mediterranean trio of wine, oil and cereals are the crops most frequently mentioned by all the classical authors when referring to the Iberian Peninsula. These were not the only plants cultivated here. Trogus Pompey, in his Universal History (44. 1-2), praises, as well as those products, the fertility of the soil itself, the benevolence of its climate, the opportune and abundant rains which enable all types of fruits to be gathered, thus supplying every need. He describes the linen and esparto grass as of the highest quality. Strabo recorded the tradition of irrigation as a common practice in pre-Roman agriculture (Strabo 3.2.5). This was continued by the Romans, as shown by the number of aqueducts, dams and small reservoirs still to be found on Spanish soil. Pliny, during his stay as procurator in Spain in the first century, gives more specific descriptions of the flora throughout his Natural History (Book XVI). Martial (Epigrams II) refers to myrtle, box and laurel, as common elements to be found in the garden of country houses in Spain.
It is not strange, therefore, that gardening, the work of the topiarius, was usual in Iberian houses, as this study shows. It was not, however, totally new to Spanish territory. Although there are no literary references to gardening in the Pre-Roman era, it must have been part of Iberian culture, as is proved in an unusual way in the northwest of the peninsula in the area under the influence of Greek culture from the city of Emporion (Ampurias or Empuriae). A Hellenic establishment there, Rhode (Rosas), in the third century BC minted drachmas with a rose as the emblem. There were sacred woods connected with the cities. Close to Augustas Emeritas was Lucus Feroniae. Dedicated to Augustus was Lucus Augusti, which gave rise to the present-day Lugo, in Galicia, and another Lucus existed in the environs of Gijón, the Lugo de Llanera (Blázquez, p. 24).
There has been little research on the gardens in the Roman settlements in Spain and Portugal. In drawing up the list of sites with gardens for this catalog, we have accepted that a garden existed when it was so labeled by the excavators. There are, however, many other probable gardens which we have included. Gorges found just under forty villas where enough remained to draw a plan. In them, certain features help to identify a garden. A peristyle alerts us to suspect a garden, but peristyle courtyards were sometimes paved with stones or bricks over a layer of lime. They were clearly not gardens. But if the courtyard had soil in it, it was in all probability a garden. Fountains, fountain statues, and pools are typical of a garden since water is indispensable for a garden. Most peristyles in Roman villas in Spain had ornamental irrigation channels, semicircular pools, wells or pools that gave the impression of still water that, nevertheless, endowed the garden with a cool humidity that favored the cultivation of plants. In Spain, peristyles with drainage are found in the first and second centuries AD and are also common in the late Empire. Certain types of statuary intimately connected with vegetation and nature are found in gardens, such as divinities related to Bacchus and his circle. At Pompeii, Diana, a garden goddess, sometimes paired with Apollo, is also found. Herms were placed on pilasters, as the examples in situ from Pompeii show. Characteristic of Roman villas was the way in which they opened out to the countryside onto a grand vista of gardens and parks filled with fountains.
The roughly triangular province of Tarraconensis, by far the largest of the three provinces of the Iberian Peninsula, stretched across the north side of modern Spain and down the east coast as far as Almeria. On the Atlantic coast, it reached as far south as present Oporto.

  Location Segóbriga
Segóbriga (Pleiades)
Location Description Segóbriga, a deserted Roman city with theater, amphitheater, forum, walls, aqueduct and baths, lies about 100 kilometers southeast of Madrid. Livy speaks of it as a noble and powerful town subdued by the Romans in 179 BC. In the 1st century BC it grew as a center for trade, cereal and cattle production, and for mining gypsum, lapis specularis, then used for windows. It became a municipium in th time of Augustus. The city reached its height near the end of the 1st century AD, then began a slow decline, but even in Visigothic time it sent bishops to councils.
Within the city, there are remarkably few remains of residences. Presumably the population that filled the theater and amphitheater lived in country villas or closer to the mines. The site has been developed as an archaeological park; the monuments are in remarkably good condition and are eminently visitable.

      <description>Province Lusitania
Lusitania(Pleiades)
Province Description Despite the prior existence of urban centers like Metellinum, the capital of Lusitania was a new foundation, the Colonia Augusta Emerita (Mérida), which would also serve as the capital of one of the smaller juridical units (conventus) and would be the scene of flourishing activity in the succeeding centuries, its prosperity lasting until the late Roman and Visigothic era. Subsequently, a series of well-known Roman cities were built in what was then Lusitania but is now partly in Portugal and partly in Spain. As well as the capital, there were Conimbriga, Salmantica, Evora, Olisipo (now Lisbon), Pax Iulia (now Beja), and Metallium Viscascense (Aljustrel), this last recognized as the capital of an important mining area. The series of wealthy villae, such as that of La Cocosa, Milreu or San Cucufate are particularly noteworthy. Another of the important elements of the Roman era is the series of still visible ways of communication, of which the Vía de la Plata has most remaining, especially in the sections of Baños de Montemayor in Cáceres or the bridges that cross the rivers, such as that of San Pedro de Alcántara, or of Mérida.
Location Emerita Augusta
Emerita Augusta (Pleiades)
Location Description Geopolitical and economic motives together facilitated the prosperity of this great center of the Iberian peninsula. Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, son-in-law of the emperor, was a benefactor of Augusta Emerita. The city was situated on the right bank of the Anas River (Rio Guardiana), today the Guadiana River. The site had the advantage of an easily crossed ford at the mouth of the Barraeca River (Rio Albarregas), and was an ideal site for surveillance and defense. The area immediately surrounding Augusta Emerita had rich granite quarries, sands from the riverbed, and other types of rock for the new constructions. The city’s topography determined the new rectilinear urban layout. The variations in ground level, due to small hills in the land, probably necessitated terracing, which is still discernible in today’s modern network of streets. The bridge over the Guadiana, the longest in the peninsula with a length of almost 800 meters, provided the N-S axis to which the street grid was aligned. The new colony also had an ambitious system of urban drainage. The sewers and water lines form a complete underground complex of canals. The works of hydraulic engineering, whose dates of construction and later stages of development are debated, support the notion that Augusta Emerita was a city with a grand, forward-looking vision.
At the intersection of the decumanus and cardo were two fora, one for the city&amp;rsquo;s functions and one for the Province&amp;rsquo;s functions. Some of the monumental buildings have been excavated. The Mérida fora, whose layouts resemble those in the other western imperial provinces, have iconographic programs that resemble those of Rome; the forum of Augusta Emerita is a particularly faithful reflection of the Forum Augustum. This imitative trend appears also in the two other provincial capitals of Hispania, Tarraco and Corduba and underscores the power which Augustan images and architecture had in the political, ideological fabric of the provinces.
The area of Augusta Emerita best known today, because of extensive excavations, is around the so-called Temple of Diana. The temple is actually dedicated to the imperial cult. The structures devoted to public performance - theater, amphitheater, and circus - surrounded the urban center. The theater was begun in 16-15 BC and the amphitheater in 8 BC, during the first decades of colonial presence. Augusta Emerita’s necropolis ran around the city’s urban perimeter and expanded as the city proper grew.
Because most of evidence from Merida was unearthed in old excavations, the context of many ancient objects is unknown. There is also a lack of analytical data on many of the areas which must originally have been gardened. The classification of the gardens of the Colonia Augusta Emerita is still under analysis. The study by Moreno is a basic survey article and should be understood to be part of all the bibliographies for Merida.

José Álvarez Sáenz de Buruaga. It remains unpublished. The principal element of its peristyle is a deep rectangular pool with a semicircular extension from the middle of one long side. The room opposite this pool, the largest of the house, was paved in opus sectile; several other rooms surrounding the peristyle had mosaic floors. The presence of a peristyle and pool strongly suggests a garden.

Keywords  peristyles (columnades) mosaics (visual works) water wells colonnades courtyards triclinia  Garden Description Next to the Amphitheater, on the east side of Augusta Emerita, are the remains of two extramural residences. The archaeological excavations of these domestic structures were begun in 1947 by José de Calasanz Serra Ráfols, who was succeeded by M. Pous, Álvarez Sáenz de Buruaga, and E. García Sandoval. Although chronologically distinct, the two houses are known together as the &amp;ldquo;House of the Amphitheater&amp;rdquo; due to their proximity to that monument.
The first of these houses is called the &amp;ldquo;House of the Water Tower&amp;rdquo; after a nearby water tower (Number 4 in LUS 4.1.1) and dates to the second century A.D. Today, only the remains of a few chambers and a colonnaded courtyard (Fig. 3) with a small channel running around the perimeter of its pavement survive.
The second house, which is better preserved, is more correctly dubbed the &amp;ldquo;House of the Amphitheater&amp;rdquo; (Figs. 4 and 5). It dates to the third century A.D. and remained in use until the fifth century A.D. The &amp;ldquo;House of the Amphitheater&amp;rdquo; was organized around a colonnaded courtyard of ample dimensions, whose interior served as a garden with individual rooms opening onto it. Roughly trapezoidal, it was surrounded on all sides by colonnades with granite columns originally sheathed with red stucco. The longer east and west sides had six columns, while the shorter north and south sides had five. A low rubble wall contained the lower portions of the shafts on the north, south, and east sides, leaving the west side open for easy access to the garden. At the foot of the colonnade and running along the garden edge (except on the west) was a canal of some depth with a semicircular curve on its eastern edge in front of an important chamber. Next to the curve and within the garden, a well was found.
The house, of sizeable proportions, boasted important painted and mosaic decoration. Of the three chambers situated along the southeast gallery, the center chamber had opus signinum pavement and has been interpreted as a triclinium, from which one could enjoy magnificent views of the garden. The pavement of the contiguous chamber to the northeast has a beautiful mosaic with representations of Venus and Cupid surrounded with floral designsand &amp;ldquo;The Mosaic of the Grape Harvest&amp;rdquo; (Mosaico de la Vendimia). They were repaired in antiquity.
An equally important second nucleus of this house consisted of a complex of rooms at its east end. This area had handsome mosaic pavements and communicated with the aforementioned peristyle through an L-shaped passageway. Its largest chamber, which had the character of a show room, if not a triclinium, is known as the &amp;ldquo;Hall of the Fish Mosaic&amp;rdquo; (Habitación del Mosaico de los Peces) and is dated to the 3rd century AD. Although this second group of rooms was probably organized around courtyards or gardens, none have been documented because this part of the residence remains unexcavated. The peristyle of the House of the Amphitheater, as well as the plan of the entire residence, has close parallels in the eastern Mediterranean which have been thoroughly studied by A. Balil.

Keywords  peristyles (columnades) colonnades rural villas atriums axial plan courtyards  Garden Description The great house built adjacent to the San Albin Hill, in the extreme southwest of the city, offers a handsome example of a suburban domus, whose refined decoration indicates an owner with intellectual and philosophical interests. The house derives its name from its proximity to the remains of a possible Mithraeum lying beneath the present-day bullring. The chronology given for this domus extends from the end of the first to the fourth century AD.
The peristyle surrounded a garden with a pool, and was situated on axis with the atrium but further south and at a lower level. Running between the granite columns of the portico is a brick wall (one meter in height) from which extended perpendicular salients on the side facing the pool. These were decorated with a program consisting of floral motives and rhomboidal openwork with bluish trefoils. Only part of this decorative program survives. From the southwest corner of the rectangular pool a brick water channel ran along the south and east sides of the area surrounding the pool to the north-east corner of the courtyard. The hydraulic apparatus was completed by a cistern with a granite rim on the west side of the peristyle. The relationship of these elements to the rest of the complex is unknown.
The lower part of the walls of the peristyle were painted with a dado of small rectangular panels with white and yellow rhomboids and floral decoration separated by white lines. Above this dado, green vertical bands separated large bluish panels decorated with vegetal designs and geometric motives suggesting candelabras. There were chambers, whose functions are unknown, on either side of the passageway that extended between this peristyle and the atrium to the north; the chamber on the west side, known as the ‘Painted Hall’ (‘Habitación de las Pinturas’), presents a pictorial program of candelabras and painted dados representing birds and plants, dated to the second century AD.
West-southwest of the peristyle, a group of interesting chambers were arrayed around a delightful garden of ample proportions. The latter consisted of a rectangular space surrounded by stucco-clad granite columns on all four sides as well as a channel running around the perimeter just in front of the columns, except on the west side where the channel curves inward to form a semi-circle. The interior of this space was clearly gardened, although the excavators found no clue as to its original appearance. On the extreme south side, attached to one of the columns, are the partial remains of a peculiar brick structure which had a hole in its lower part for the passage of water. Its function is unclear. The pictorial decoration of this viridarium resembles that of the peristyle’s dado.
The passage formed by the north colonnade gave access to three chambers, the middle one a triclinium, with mosaic pavements and wall dados painted with birds and vegetal themes. On the west side, facing the garden&amp;rsquo;s exedra, was a chamber with Bacchic murals (now in the Museo Nacional de Arte Romano) and below its floor, a great barrel-vaulted cistern. On the south side, several rooms formed what may have been a cubiculum (bedroom) with mosaics whose themes included Eros with a dove. Two subterranean rooms in the southeast corner of this same group probably provided cool refuge from the summer heat.

      <description>Province Lusitania
Lusitania(Pleiades)
Province Description Despite the prior existence of urban centers like Metellinum, the capital of Lusitania was a new foundation, the Colonia Augusta Emerita (Mérida), which would also serve as the capital of one of the smaller juridical units (conventus) and would be the scene of flourishing activity in the succeeding centuries, its prosperity lasting until the late Roman and Visigothic era. Subsequently, a series of well-known Roman cities were built in what was then Lusitania but is now partly in Portugal and partly in Spain. As well as the capital, there were Conimbriga, Salmantica, Evora, Olisipo (now Lisbon), Pax Iulia (now Beja), and Metallium Viscascense (Aljustrel), this last recognized as the capital of an important mining area. The series of wealthy villae, such as that of La Cocosa, Milreu or San Cucufate are particularly noteworthy. Another of the important elements of the Roman era is the series of still visible ways of communication, of which the Vía de la Plata has most remaining, especially in the sections of Baños de Montemayor in Cáceres or the bridges that cross the rivers, such as that of San Pedro de Alcántara, or of Mérida.
Location Emerita Augusta
Emerita Augusta (Pleiades)
Location Description Geopolitical and economic motives together facilitated the prosperity of this great center of the Iberian peninsula. Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, son-in-law of the emperor, was a benefactor of Augusta Emerita. The city was situated on the right bank of the Anas River (Rio Guardiana), today the Guadiana River. The site had the advantage of an easily crossed ford at the mouth of the Barraeca River (Rio Albarregas), and was an ideal site for surveillance and defense. The area immediately surrounding Augusta Emerita had rich granite quarries, sands from the riverbed, and other types of rock for the new constructions. The city’s topography determined the new rectilinear urban layout. The variations in ground level, due to small hills in the land, probably necessitated terracing, which is still discernible in today’s modern network of streets. The bridge over the Guadiana, the longest in the peninsula with a length of almost 800 meters, provided the N-S axis to which the street grid was aligned. The new colony also had an ambitious system of urban drainage. The sewers and water lines form a complete underground complex of canals. The works of hydraulic engineering, whose dates of construction and later stages of development are debated, support the notion that Augusta Emerita was a city with a grand, forward-looking vision.
At the intersection of the decumanus and cardo were two fora, one for the city&amp;rsquo;s functions and one for the Province&amp;rsquo;s functions. Some of the monumental buildings have been excavated. The Mérida fora, whose layouts resemble those in the other western imperial provinces, have iconographic programs that resemble those of Rome; the forum of Augusta Emerita is a particularly faithful reflection of the Forum Augustum. This imitative trend appears also in the two other provincial capitals of Hispania, Tarraco and Corduba and underscores the power which Augustan images and architecture had in the political, ideological fabric of the provinces.
The area of Augusta Emerita best known today, because of extensive excavations, is around the so-called Temple of Diana. The temple is actually dedicated to the imperial cult. The structures devoted to public performance - theater, amphitheater, and circus - surrounded the urban center. The theater was begun in 16-15 BC and the amphitheater in 8 BC, during the first decades of colonial presence. Augusta Emerita’s necropolis ran around the city’s urban perimeter and expanded as the city proper grew.
Because most of evidence from Merida was unearthed in old excavations, the context of many ancient objects is unknown. There is also a lack of analytical data on many of the areas which must originally have been gardened. The classification of the gardens of the Colonia Augusta Emerita is still under analysis. The study by Moreno is a basic survey article and should be understood to be part of all the bibliographies for Merida.

Keywords  peristyles (columnades) courtyards porticoes exedrae (site elements)  Garden Description Prior to building the present Museo Nacional de Arte Romano, excavations were undertaken at the site in 1978 and 1979. Two suburban residences were explored and preserved in the crypt of the museum. These contained at least three courtyards. One was a colonnaded courtyard of ‘marble,’ and this small rectangular courtyard (at the rear of the crypt) consisted of a low wall of mortared rubble with simple marble columns of the Tuscan order. It was surrounded by incompletely excavated chambers, one of which had a program of wall paintings and stuccos which dated the complex to the period first through the fourth century A.D.
Another had a peristyle with an exedra. This was a small rectangular peristyle (near the stairs leading down to the crypt) with stucco-clad brick columns except in the corners where square pilasters were substituted. In the porticoes formed by these, the walls were painted. Wrapping around the courtyard proper were segments of a brick canal revetted with painted stucco. On its interiors, the canal was revetted with opus signinum and its floor had quarter-circle reinforcement. On the courtyard’s east side, off center, a semi-circular exedra led to what was probably the most impressive chamber in the house. The remains of another colonnaded court (in the southeast corner of the crypt) consisted of two rubblework walls forming a corner and supporting marble columns of the Tuscan order; the corridor formed by this colonnade was paved with opus signinum.

Keywords  colonnades water supply systems peristyles (columnades) fountains  Garden Description The space behind the theater screen comprises one of the best preserved gardens of Augusta Emerita. It consisted of a rectangular enclosure surrounded on the north, east, and west sides by ambulatories formed by double colonnades of granite with Corinthian capitals and red-stuccoed bases. The wall within these walkways had niches with paintings, of which few traces remain. In addition to entering through the screen, access was also possible via a small flight of granite steps in the southeast corner from the street, which separated this monument from the Amphitheater.
A water channel bordered the exterior of the colonnade, emptying into two small square depressions in the northeast and northwest corners which connected to the drains traversing the north side of the peristyle. Water, indispensable for irrigation and the fountains, was in ample supply, probably owing to the theate&amp;rsquo;s proximity to the San Lázaro water canal. Parallel to the portico of the rear of the proscenium (stage), in the eastern part, ran a wall which expanded in the form of an exedra, forming a semicircular space for a statue. But the most interesting element of the peristyle, located at the back of it and on axis with the valva regia, was an aula sacar locate on plan, dedicated to the imperial cult. In front of this was a small marble fountain decorated with vegetal motifs. The aula sacra consisted of a small rectangular chamber with marble revetted walls and niches for statues. Inside, four toga-clad statues, a veiled head of Augustus, and a head of Tiberius were found.
While the theater belongs to multiple phases of construction, the aula sacra belongs to a Tiberian phase. The peristyle&amp;rsquo;s important program of sculptures and paintings, together with the green spaces, must have given the edifice a magnificent appearance. Unfortunately, many of its decorative elements, wall paintings, bronzes, and marble paving slabs do not survive, and there are few remaining works of statuary, although these are marble and well made.
Water, indispensable for irrigation and the fountains, was in ample supply, probably owing to the theate&amp;rsquo;s proximity to the San Lázaro water canal. The present appearance of the peristyle is the result of restorations carried out in 1964 by J. Menéndez-Pidal in which the south wing of the peristyle was resurrected and covered with a pergola and the fountain restored to working order.

      <description>Province Hispania Tarraconensis
Tarraconensis(Pleiades)
Province Description In 236 BC, to offset Carthage&amp;rsquo;s loss of Sicily and Sardinia in the First Punic War, Hamilcar Barca led an expedition into Hispania to establish a colony there. Through force of arms and diplomacy, he spread Carthaginian influence as far north as Barcellona, which bears his name. In 230 BC, Hasdrubal, his son-in-law, established Qart Hadast that became Carthago Nova in Roman times and Cartagena today. After the death of Hasdrubal, Hannibal, Hamilcar&amp;rsquo;s oldest son, took command, attacked Saguntum, and in 218 set out for Italy leaving his younger brother, Hasdrubal, in command in Spain. Through the Alps, he descended into Italy and threatened Rome for fourteen years. Roman armies under the brothers Gnaeus and Publius Cornelius Scipio kept Hasdrubal in check and prevented his reinforcing Hannibal. They were both killed by the Carthaginians in 212. Two years later, another Publius Cornelius Scipio, the 25-year-old son of the late general of the same name, was sent to Spain. The next year, he captured New Carthage and, in 206 at the battle of Ilipa (about 15 km north of Savilla) destroyed most of the Carthaginians&amp;rsquo; numerically superior army and ended their hold on Spain. Scipio settled his wounded veterans nearby at a place he called Italica to remind them of their origins. Today, it is one of the best Roman archaeological sites in Italy. After a quick trip back to Rome, where he was elected consul, he returned to Spain and went on to attack Carthage itself. Hannibal was recalled to Africa, but Scipio annihilated his army in 202. Rome thus came into possession of the Mediterranean coast of Iberia.
If Rome was drawn into Hispania to keep the Carthaginians there from supporting Hannibal in Italy, it missed the opportunity offered by Hannibal&amp;rsquo;s defeat to get out of Spain honorably. Instead, in 197 BC it created two new Roman provinces, Hispania Citerior whose capital was Carthago Nova and Hispania Ulterior with Corduba as its capital. Soon after, Rome launched a long war to subjugate the Lusitani, Celtiberians on the west coast. During Sulla&amp;rsquo;s dictatorship, the Lusitani were again in revolt, this time under the able leadership of the Roman general Quintus Sertorius, who sought to create an independent, Roman-like state in Hispania. He established a senate and schools for the sons of the local nobility.
Augustus&amp;rsquo;s conquest of Hispania produced a new territorial division that replaced the earlier two-province organization of the region. Augustus divided the whole of the peninsula into three provinces: Hispania Citerior or Tarraconensis, with its capital Tarraco (Tarragona); Hispania Ulterior Baetica, with its capital Corduba (Córdoba); and Hispania Ulterior Lusitania, or Emerita Augusta, with its capital Mérida. The provinces, in turn, were subdivided in administrative legal units, or conventus. The western lands stayed part of the newly demarcated Lusitania, areas into which Romanization had hardly penetrated, in contrast to the other areas of the peninsula where the classical tradition had been incorporated quite early. This division lasted until late antiquity, when Tarraconensis was subdivided into three provinces: Tarraconensis, whose capital continued to be Tarraco (Tarragona), Carthaginiensis, with Carthago Nova (Catagena) as its capital, and Gallaecia, whose capital was Bracara Augusta (Braga, in northern Portugal).
The Mediterranean trio of wine, oil and cereals are the crops most frequently mentioned by all the classical authors when referring to the Iberian Peninsula. These were not the only plants cultivated here. Trogus Pompey, in his Universal History (44. 1-2), praises, as well as those products, the fertility of the soil itself, the benevolence of its climate, the opportune and abundant rains which enable all types of fruits to be gathered, thus supplying every need. He describes the linen and esparto grass as of the highest quality. Strabo recorded the tradition of irrigation as a common practice in pre-Roman agriculture (Strabo 3.2.5). This was continued by the Romans, as shown by the number of aqueducts, dams and small reservoirs still to be found on Spanish soil. Pliny, during his stay as procurator in Spain in the first century, gives more specific descriptions of the flora throughout his Natural History (Book XVI). Martial (Epigrams II) refers to myrtle, box and laurel, as common elements to be found in the garden of country houses in Spain.
It is not strange, therefore, that gardening, the work of the topiarius, was usual in Iberian houses, as this study shows. It was not, however, totally new to Spanish territory. Although there are no literary references to gardening in the Pre-Roman era, it must have been part of Iberian culture, as is proved in an unusual way in the northwest of the peninsula in the area under the influence of Greek culture from the city of Emporion (Ampurias or Empuriae). A Hellenic establishment there, Rhode (Rosas), in the third century BC minted drachmas with a rose as the emblem. There were sacred woods connected with the cities. Close to Augustas Emeritas was Lucus Feroniae. Dedicated to Augustus was Lucus Augusti, which gave rise to the present-day Lugo, in Galicia, and another Lucus existed in the environs of Gijón, the Lugo de Llanera (Blázquez, p. 24).
There has been little research on the gardens in the Roman settlements in Spain and Portugal. In drawing up the list of sites with gardens for this catalog, we have accepted that a garden existed when it was so labeled by the excavators. There are, however, many other probable gardens which we have included. Gorges found just under forty villas where enough remained to draw a plan. In them, certain features help to identify a garden. A peristyle alerts us to suspect a garden, but peristyle courtyards were sometimes paved with stones or bricks over a layer of lime. They were clearly not gardens. But if the courtyard had soil in it, it was in all probability a garden. Fountains, fountain statues, and pools are typical of a garden since water is indispensable for a garden. Most peristyles in Roman villas in Spain had ornamental irrigation channels, semicircular pools, wells or pools that gave the impression of still water that, nevertheless, endowed the garden with a cool humidity that favored the cultivation of plants. In Spain, peristyles with drainage are found in the first and second centuries AD and are also common in the late Empire. Certain types of statuary intimately connected with vegetation and nature are found in gardens, such as divinities related to Bacchus and his circle. At Pompeii, Diana, a garden goddess, sometimes paired with Apollo, is also found. Herms were placed on pilasters, as the examples in situ from Pompeii show. Characteristic of Roman villas was the way in which they opened out to the countryside onto a grand vista of gardens and parks filled with fountains.
The roughly triangular province of Tarraconensis, by far the largest of the three provinces of the Iberian Peninsula, stretched across the north side of modern Spain and down the east coast as far as Almeria. On the Atlantic coast, it reached as far south as present Oporto.

Keywords  garden ornaments nymphaea (garden structures) statues  Garden Description The Schola of the collegium fabrum had a nympheum (a) decorated by a sculptural group of two figures pouring water (a reclining nymph and a group with a drunken Dionysus supported by Silenius) and at least two other sculptures, a sleeping Eros and a herakliskos – the infant Hercules struggling with snakes. The presence of a highly decorative nymphaeum and Dionysiac sculpture group suggests the presence of a garden.

During Sulla&amp;rsquo;s dictatorship, the Lusitani were again in revolt, this time under the able leadership of the Roman general Quintus Sertorius, who sought to create an independent, Roman-like state in Hispania. He established a senate and schools for the sons of the local nobility.
Augustus&amp;rsquo;s conquest of Hispania produced a new territorial division that replaced the earlier two-province organization of the region. Augustus divided the whole of the peninsula into three provinces: Hispania Citerior or Tarraconensis, with its capital Tarraco (Tarragona); Hispania Ulterior Baetica, with its capital Corduba (Córdoba); and Hispania Ulterior Lusitania, or Emerita Augusta, with its capital Mérida. The provinces, in turn, were subdivided in administrative legal units, or conventus. The western lands stayed part of the newly demarcated Lusitania, areas into which Romanization had hardly penetrated, in contrast to the other areas of the peninsula where the classical tradition had been incorporated quite early. This division lasted until late antiquity, when Tarraconensis was subdivided into three provinces: Tarraconensis, whose capital continued to be Tarraco (Tarragona), Carthaginiensis, with Carthago Nova (Catagena) as its capital, and Gallaecia, whose capital was Bracara Augusta (Braga, in northern Portugal).
The Mediterranean trio of wine, oil and cereals are the crops most frequently mentioned by all the classical authors when referring to the Iberian Peninsula. These were not the only plants cultivated here. Trogus Pompey, in his Universal History (44. 1-2), praises, as well as those products, the fertility of the soil itself, the benevolence of its climate, the opportune and abundant rains which enable all types of fruits to be gathered, thus supplying every need. He describes the linen and esparto grass as of the highest quality. Strabo recorded the tradition of irrigation as a common practice in pre-Roman agriculture (Strabo 3.2.5). This was continued by the Romans, as shown by the number of aqueducts, dams and small reservoirs still to be found on Spanish soil. Pliny, during his stay as procurator in Spain in the first century, gives more specific descriptions of the flora throughout his Natural History (Book XVI). Martial (Epigrams II) refers to myrtle, box and laurel, as common elements to be found in the garden of country houses in Spain.
It is not strange, therefore, that gardening, the work of the topiarius, was usual in Iberian houses, as this study shows. It was not, however, totally new to Spanish territory. Although there are no literary references to gardening in the Pre-Roman era, it must have been part of Iberian culture, as is proved in an unusual way in the northwest of the peninsula in the area under the influence of Greek culture from the city of Emporion (Ampurias or Empuriae). A Hellenic establishment there, Rhode (Rosas), in the third century BC minted drachmas with a rose as the emblem. There were sacred woods connected with the cities. Close to Augustas Emeritas was Lucus Feroniae. Dedicated to Augustus was Lucus Augusti, which gave rise to the present-day Lugo, in Galicia, and another Lucus existed in the environs of Gijón, the Lugo de Llanera (Blázquez, p. 24).
There has been little research on the gardens in the Roman settlements in Spain and Portugal. In drawing up the list of sites with gardens for this catalog, we have accepted that a garden existed when it was so labeled by the excavators. There are, however, many other probable gardens which we have included. Gorges found just under forty villas where enough remained to draw a plan. In them, certain features help to identify a garden. A peristyle alerts us to suspect a garden, but peristyle courtyards were sometimes paved with stones or bricks over a layer of lime. They were clearly not gardens. But if the courtyard had soil in it, it was in all probability a garden. Fountains, fountain statues, and pools are typical of a garden since water is indispensable for a garden. Most peristyles in Roman villas in Spain had ornamental irrigation channels, semicircular pools, wells or pools that gave the impression of still water that, nevertheless, endowed the garden with a cool humidity that favored the cultivation of plants. In Spain, peristyles with drainage are found in the first and second centuries AD and are also common in the late Empire. Certain types of statuary intimately connected with vegetation and nature are found in gardens, such as divinities related to Bacchus and his circle. At Pompeii, Diana, a garden goddess, sometimes paired with Apollo, is also found. Herms were placed on pilasters, as the examples in situ from Pompeii show. Characteristic of Roman villas was the way in which they opened out to the countryside onto a grand vista of gardens and parks filled with fountains.
The roughly triangular province of Tarraconensis, by far the largest of the three provinces of the Iberian Peninsula, stretched across the north side of modern Spain and down the east coast as far as Almeria. On the Atlantic coast, it reached as far south as present Oporto.

Location Description Despite the rather sparse archaeological evidence for gardens in Tarragona, one of the most important cities of Roman Spain, there is a brief passage at the beginning of Vergilius orator an poeta by Publius Annius Florus, friend of Hadrian, in which he described a temple garden thought to be in Tarragona, though the city is not mentioned explicitly: While I was passing through the temple enclosure my head full of the fatigues of the day, pleasantly resting in the shade of many trees by cool running water breathing fresh air, I suddenly came upon a group of people…

Keywords  garden ornaments nymphaea (garden structures) statues  Garden Description The Schola of the collegium fabrum had a nympheum (a) decorated by a sculptural group of two figures pouring water (a reclining nymph and a group with a drunken Dionysus supported by Silenius) and at least two other sculptures, a sleeping Eros and a herakliskos – the infant Hercules struggling with snakes. The presence of a highly decorative nymphaeum and Dionysiac sculpture group suggests the presence of a garden.

      <description>Province Lusitania
Lusitania(Pleiades)
Province Description Despite the prior existence of urban centers like Metellinum, the capital of Lusitania was a new foundation, the Colonia Augusta Emerita (Mérida), which would also serve as the capital of one of the smaller juridical units (conventus) and would be the scene of flourishing activity in the succeeding centuries, its prosperity lasting until the late Roman and Visigothic era. Subsequently, a series of well-known Roman cities were built in what was then Lusitania but is now partly in Portugal and partly in Spain. As well as the capital, there were Conimbriga, Salmantica, Evora, Olisipo (now Lisbon), Pax Iulia (now Beja), and Metallium Viscascense (Aljustrel), this last recognized as the capital of an important mining area. The series of wealthy villae, such as that of La Cocosa, Milreu or San Cucufate are particularly noteworthy. Another of the important elements of the Roman era is the series of still visible ways of communication, of which the Vía de la Plata has most remaining, especially in the sections of Baños de Montemayor in Cáceres or the bridges that cross the rivers, such as that of San Pedro de Alcántara, or of Mérida.
Location Emerita Augusta
Emerita Augusta (Pleiades)
Location Description Geopolitical and economic motives together facilitated the prosperity of this great center of the Iberian peninsula. Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, son-in-law of the emperor, was a benefactor of Augusta Emerita. The city was situated on the right bank of the Anas River (Rio Guardiana), today the Guadiana River. The site had the advantage of an easily crossed ford at the mouth of the Barraeca River (Rio Albarregas), and was an ideal site for surveillance and defense. The area immediately surrounding Augusta Emerita had rich granite quarries, sands from the riverbed, and other types of rock for the new constructions. The city’s topography determined the new rectilinear urban layout. The variations in ground level, due to small hills in the land, probably necessitated terracing, which is still discernible in today’s modern network of streets. The bridge over the Guadiana, the longest in the peninsula with a length of almost 800 meters, provided the N-S axis to which the street grid was aligned. The new colony also had an ambitious system of urban drainage. The sewers and water lines form a complete underground complex of canals. The works of hydraulic engineering, whose dates of construction and later stages of development are debated, support the notion that Augusta Emerita was a city with a grand, forward-looking vision.
At the intersection of the decumanus and cardo were two fora, one for the city&amp;rsquo;s functions and one for the Province&amp;rsquo;s functions. Some of the monumental buildings have been excavated. The Mérida fora, whose layouts resemble those in the other western imperial provinces, have iconographic programs that resemble those of Rome; the forum of Augusta Emerita is a particularly faithful reflection of the Forum Augustum. This imitative trend appears also in the two other provincial capitals of Hispania, Tarraco and Corduba and underscores the power which Augustan images and architecture had in the political, ideological fabric of the provinces.
The area of Augusta Emerita best known today, because of extensive excavations, is around the so-called Temple of Diana. The temple is actually dedicated to the imperial cult. The structures devoted to public performance - theater, amphitheater, and circus - surrounded the urban center. The theater was begun in 16-15 BC and the amphitheater in 8 BC, during the first decades of colonial presence. Augusta Emerita’s necropolis ran around the city’s urban perimeter and expanded as the city proper grew.
Because most of evidence from Merida was unearthed in old excavations, the context of many ancient objects is unknown. There is also a lack of analytical data on many of the areas which must originally have been gardened. The classification of the gardens of the Colonia Augusta Emerita is still under analysis. The study by Moreno is a basic survey article and should be understood to be part of all the bibliographies for Merida.

Keywords  porticoes fountains waterspouts courtyards  Garden Description The Temple of Diana is the only surviving religious building from the Augusta Emerita Forum. Despite its name, it was actually dedicated to the imperial cult and dates to the end of the Augustan period. Excavations conducted in 1972 by J. Mª. Álvarez Martínez produced some evidence for a garden in conjunction with the temple. The space surrounding the temple was interpreted as a garden area, enclosed by a portico, which contained two rectangular pools on the east and west sides of the temple. Of the sculptural pieces found outside the temple, some have been situated in the western pool: a bronze leg (forming part of an idealized figure and probably fixed on the base of the pool) and two marble fragments of tragic masks which could have served as fountain spouts.

      <description>Province Hispania Tarraconensis
Tarraconensis(Pleiades)
Province Description In 236 BC, to offset Carthage&amp;rsquo;s loss of Sicily and Sardinia in the First Punic War, Hamilcar Barca led an expedition into Hispania to establish a colony there. Through force of arms and diplomacy, he spread Carthaginian influence as far north as Barcellona, which bears his name. In 230 BC, Hasdrubal, his son-in-law, established Qart Hadast that became Carthago Nova in Roman times and Cartagena today. After the death of Hasdrubal, Hannibal, Hamilcar&amp;rsquo;s oldest son, took command, attacked Saguntum, and in 218 set out for Italy leaving his younger brother, Hasdrubal, in command in Spain. Through the Alps, he descended into Italy and threatened Rome for fourteen years. Roman armies under the brothers Gnaeus and Publius Cornelius Scipio kept Hasdrubal in check and prevented his reinforcing Hannibal. They were both killed by the Carthaginians in 212. Two years later, another Publius Cornelius Scipio, the 25-year-old son of the late general of the same name, was sent to Spain. The next year, he captured New Carthage and, in 206 at the battle of Ilipa (about 15 km north of Savilla) destroyed most of the Carthaginians&amp;rsquo; numerically superior army and ended their hold on Spain. Scipio settled his wounded veterans nearby at a place he called Italica to remind them of their origins. Today, it is one of the best Roman archaeological sites in Italy. After a quick trip back to Rome, where he was elected consul, he returned to Spain and went on to attack Carthage itself. Hannibal was recalled to Africa, but Scipio annihilated his army in 202. Rome thus came into possession of the Mediterranean coast of Iberia.
If Rome was drawn into Hispania to keep the Carthaginians there from supporting Hannibal in Italy, it missed the opportunity offered by Hannibal&amp;rsquo;s defeat to get out of Spain honorably. Instead, in 197 BC it created two new Roman provinces, Hispania Citerior whose capital was Carthago Nova and Hispania Ulterior with Corduba as its capital. Soon after, Rome launched a long war to subjugate the Lusitani, Celtiberians on the west coast. During Sulla&amp;rsquo;s dictatorship, the Lusitani were again in revolt, this time under the able leadership of the Roman general Quintus Sertorius, who sought to create an independent, Roman-like state in Hispania.

Garden Theater
Keywords  nymphaea (garden structures) cryptoportici fountains stairs  Garden Description The theater of Tarraco is poorly preserved. Part of the orchestra, the proscaenium, the scaena frons, the first five rows of seats, and a cryptoporticus running parallel to the curved façade survive. Connected to the theater was a monumental nympheum (a) and a large garden area (b), through which privileged spectators passed to be seated in the first rows. The garden, constructed in the first century A.D. along with the theater, included the nympheum, which was in the center of a large blind wall with pilasters bordering the uneven hill. Two large bases flanked the nympheum and perhaps held monumental craters. Water from the fountain passed into a large pool, four meters deep, with fountains at either end. This large pool had walls lined with opus signinum and was topped with a molded raised edge. It now lies buried beneath a neighboring plot of ground. A small door at the end of the pilaster wall joined this whole unit to the theater. From the door, one reached the parascenium, and by means of stairs to the west, one reached the entrance of the theater.

Col. Tarraco (Pleiades)
Location Description Despite the rather sparse archaeological evidence for gardens in Tarragona, one of the most important cities of Roman Spain, there is a brief passage at the beginning of Vergilius orator an poeta by Publius Annius Florus, friend of Hadrian, in which he described a temple garden thought to be in Tarragona, though the city is not mentioned explicitly: While I was passing through the temple enclosure my head full of the fatigues of the day, pleasantly resting in the shade of many trees by cool running water breathing fresh air, I suddenly came upon a group of people…
Garden Theater
Keywords  nymphaea (garden structures) cryptoportici fountains stairs  Garden Description The theater of Tarraco is poorly preserved. Part of the orchestra, the proscaenium, the scaena frons, the first five rows of seats, and a cryptoporticus running parallel to the curved façade survive. Connected to the theater was a monumental nympheum (a) and a large garden area (b), through which privileged spectators passed to be seated in the first rows. The garden, constructed in the first century A.D. along with the theater, included the nympheum, which was in the center of a large blind wall with pilasters bordering the uneven hill. Two large bases flanked the nympheum and perhaps held monumental craters. Water from the fountain passed into a large pool, four meters deep, with fountains at either end. This large pool had walls lined with opus signinum and was topped with a molded raised edge. It now lies buried beneath a neighboring plot of ground. A small door at the end of the pilaster wall joined this whole unit to the theater. From the door, one reached the parascenium, and by means of stairs to the west, one reached the entrance of the theater.

      <description>Province Hispania Tarraconensis
Tarraconensis(Pleiades)
Province Description In 236 BC, to offset Carthage&amp;rsquo;s loss of Sicily and Sardinia in the First Punic War, Hamilcar Barca led an expedition into Hispania to establish a colony there. Through force of arms and diplomacy, he spread Carthaginian influence as far north as Barcellona, which bears his name. In 230 BC, Hasdrubal, his son-in-law, established Qart Hadast that became Carthago Nova in Roman times and Cartagena today. After the death of Hasdrubal, Hannibal, Hamilcar&amp;rsquo;s oldest son, took command, attacked Saguntum, and in 218 set out for Italy leaving his younger brother, Hasdrubal, in command in Spain. Through the Alps, he descended into Italy and threatened Rome for fourteen years. Roman armies under the brothers Gnaeus and Publius Cornelius Scipio kept Hasdrubal in check and prevented his reinforcing Hannibal. They were both killed by the Carthaginians in 212. Two years later, another Publius Cornelius Scipio, the 25-year-old son of the late general of the same name, was sent to Spain. The next year, he captured New Carthage and, in 206 at the battle of Ilipa (about 15 km north of Savilla) destroyed most of the Carthaginians&amp;rsquo; numerically superior army and ended their hold on Spain. Scipio settled his wounded veterans nearby at a place he called Italica to remind them of their origins. Today, it is one of the best Roman archaeological sites in Italy. After a quick trip back to Rome, where he was elected consul, he returned to Spain and went on to attack Carthage itself. Hannibal was recalled to Africa, but Scipio annihilated his army in 202. Rome thus came into possession of the Mediterranean coast of Iberia.
If Rome was drawn into Hispania to keep the Carthaginians there from supporting Hannibal in Italy, it missed the opportunity offered by Hannibal&amp;rsquo;s defeat to get out of Spain honorably. Instead, in 197 BC it created two new Roman provinces, Hispania Citerior whose capital was Carthago Nova and Hispania Ulterior with Corduba as its capital. Soon after, Rome launched a long war to subjugate the Lusitani, Celtiberians on the west coast. During Sulla&amp;rsquo;s dictatorship, the Lusitani were again in revolt, this time under the able leadership of the Roman general Quintus Sertorius, who sought to create an independent, Roman-like state in Hispania. He established a senate and schools for the sons of the local nobility.
Augustus&amp;rsquo;s conquest of Hispania produced a new territorial division that replaced the earlier two-province organization of the region. Augustus divided the whole of the peninsula into three provinces: Hispania Citerior or Tarraconensis, with its capital Tarraco (Tarragona); Hispania Ulterior Baetica, with its capital Corduba (Córdoba); and Hispania Ulterior Lusitania, or Emerita Augusta, with its capital Mérida. The provinces, in turn, were subdivided in administrative legal units, or conventus. The western lands stayed part of the newly demarcated Lusitania, areas into which Romanization had hardly penetrated, in contrast to the other areas of the peninsula where the classical tradition had been incorporated quite early. This division lasted until late antiquity, when Tarraconensis was subdivided into three provinces: Tarraconensis, whose capital continued to be Tarraco (Tarragona), Carthaginiensis, with Carthago Nova (Catagena) as its capital, and Gallaecia, whose capital was Bracara Augusta (Braga, in northern Portugal).
The Mediterranean trio of wine, oil and cereals are the crops most frequently mentioned by all the classical authors when referring to the Iberian Peninsula. These were not the only plants cultivated here. Trogus Pompey, in his Universal History (44. 1-2), praises, as well as those products, the fertility of the soil itself, the benevolence of its climate, the opportune and abundant rains which enable all types of fruits to be gathered, thus supplying every need. He describes the linen and esparto grass as of the highest quality. Strabo recorded the tradition of irrigation as a common practice in pre-Roman agriculture (Strabo 3.2.5). This was continued by the Romans, as shown by the number of aqueducts, dams and small reservoirs still to be found on Spanish soil. Pliny, during his stay as procurator in Spain in the first century, gives more specific descriptions of the flora throughout his Natural History (Book XVI). Martial (Epigrams II) refers to myrtle, box and laurel, as common elements to be found in the garden of country houses in Spain.
It is not strange, therefore, that gardening, the work of the topiarius, was usual in Iberian houses, as this study shows. It was not, however, totally new to Spanish territory. Although there are no literary references to gardening in the Pre-Roman era, it must have been part of Iberian culture, as is proved in an unusual way in the northwest of the peninsula in the area under the influence of Greek culture from the city of Emporion (Ampurias or Empuriae). A Hellenic establishment there, Rhode (Rosas), in the third century BC minted drachmas with a rose as the emblem. There were sacred woods connected with the cities. Close to Augustas Emeritas was Lucus Feroniae. Dedicated to Augustus was Lucus Augusti, which gave rise to the present-day Lugo, in Galicia, and another Lucus existed in the environs of Gijón, the Lugo de Llanera (Blázquez, p. 24).
There has been little research on the gardens in the Roman settlements in Spain and Portugal. In drawing up the list of sites with gardens for this catalog, we have accepted that a garden existed when it was so labeled by the excavators. There are, however, many other probable gardens which we have included. Gorges found just under forty villas where enough remained to draw a plan. In them, certain features help to identify a garden. A peristyle alerts us to suspect a garden, but peristyle courtyards were sometimes paved with stones or bricks over a layer of lime. They were clearly not gardens. But if the courtyard had soil in it, it was in all probability a garden. Fountains, fountain statues, and pools are typical of a garden since water is indispensable for a garden. Most peristyles in Roman villas in Spain had ornamental irrigation channels, semicircular pools, wells or pools that gave the impression of still water that, nevertheless, endowed the garden with a cool humidity that favored the cultivation of plants. In Spain, peristyles with drainage are found in the first and second centuries AD and are also common in the late Empire. Certain types of statuary intimately connected with vegetation and nature are found in gardens, such as divinities related to Bacchus and his circle. At Pompeii, Diana, a garden goddess, sometimes paired with Apollo, is also found. Herms were placed on pilasters, as the examples in situ from Pompeii show. Characteristic of Roman villas was the way in which they opened out to the countryside onto a grand vista of gardens and parks filled with fountains.
The roughly triangular province of Tarraconensis, by far the largest of the three provinces of the Iberian Peninsula, stretched across the north side of modern Spain and down the east coast as far as Almeria. On the Atlantic coast, it reached as far south as present Oporto.

The ruins are reburied beneath the earth in a field, awaiting funds to present them properly. The villa was built in the first third of the 2nd century, destroyed by the Germanic invasions of the years immediately after 256, then rebuilt and enlarged under the restored empire, and finally abandoned in the 5th century. The large central peristyle courtyard (43.5 x 19 m) had porticoes on all four sides and a garden with a drainage system in the middle. On the south side, the room with the circular, quadrilobed interior had a mosaic of Ceres and a cornucopia. A series of agricultural buildings and other gardens joined it on the north side.

The Laguna Cernea is an artificial pond created by the Romans for washing gold, now frequently dry. It was presumably the residence of the offical in charge of the gold extraction. Its early, first century date underlines the importance of gold as a reason for determination of Augustus to subdue the region at great cost.
Built under Tiberius, this site is a rare if not unique example of a first century Iberian villa for which we have a complete plan. Excavation began in the 1930&amp;rsquo;s. Of modest dimensions and without mosaics, it followed an Italian plan with a central (slightly trapezoidal) peristyle with little adaptation to the much cooler climate at this elevation. It did, however, have several rooms heated by hypocausts and many rooms paved in opus signinum. There were found many fragments of wall painting (of deer, birds, and humans) and of ceramic and glass. In the center of the peristyle was a rectangular pool with protruding semi-circular niches at each corner; it was lined with painted stucco. The garden around the pool was open on the north side in front of the reception room [1]. In a later modification, the west portico was divided into four small rooms beside the garden.

Keywords  peristyles (columnades) hypocausts opus signinum reception rooms porticoes  Garden Description N 42° 27&amp;rsquo; 14” W 6° 14&amp;rsquo; 26” The villa is 300 meters eastnortheast of the eastern tip of Laguna Cernea, north of the modern village Santa Colomba de Somoza. The Laguna Cernea is an artificial pond created by the Romans for washing gold, now frequently dry. It was presumably the residence of the offical in charge of the gold extraction. Its early, first century date underlines the importance of gold as a reason for determination of Augustus to subdue the region at great cost.
Built under Tiberius, this site is a rare if not unique example of a first century Iberian villa for which we have a complete plan. Excavation began in the 1930&amp;rsquo;s. Of modest dimensions and without mosaics, it followed an Italian plan with a central (slightly trapezoidal) peristyle with little adaptation to the much cooler climate at this elevation. It did, however, have several rooms heated by hypocausts and many rooms paved in opus signinum. There were found many fragments of wall painting (of deer, birds, and humans) and of ceramic and glass. In the center of the peristyle was a rectangular pool with protruding semi-circular niches at each corner; it was lined with painted stucco. The garden around the pool was open on the north side in front of the reception room [1]. In a later modification, the west portico was divided into four small rooms beside the garden.

Stuccoed brick columns and a low wall 0.50 m. high enclosed the central area (b) and a large gutter collected water from the edges and conducted it to the cistern. A rectangular pool ca. 2.60 x 5.00 m. with the inside painted blue was located in the center of this area. At the rear of the pool an area paved with bipedales (tiles two feet long) covered the cellars below with an opening 1.70 x 2.20 to provide light. Jashemski noted that the paved and planted areas were reconstructed with a lattice fence between them, although she did not know of any evidence to support this interpretation.

The excavation of this house in 1934-1936 revealed an unusual atrium arrangement, which Maiuri states is the first time the architectural scheme that is used in a peristyle was stylishly applied to the atrium. The atrium had no fauces, there were three columns on both the north and south sides, and on the west side there were two engaged columns with two freestanding columns between them forming the entrance and supporting the room above. A collection of marble oscilla was uncovered here, second only to the collection found in the House of the Golden Cupids in Pompeii. The tondi, peltae, and pinakes were hung between the columns against the background of glossy red walls. Various Dionysiac and theater themes, satyrs, maenads, Pan, theater masks, an amorino, a sea horse and a sea panther were the subjects featured on the oscilla. The impluvium was enclosed by a low wall with a planting space on the top providing a garden atmosphere to the atrium. A marble puteal was located on the west side of the impluvium.

      <description>Province Asia
Province Description The region of what is now modern Turkey became a part of the Roman Empire in 133 BCE, when king Attalos III of Pergamum bequeathed his kingdom to the Roman people. The province included the heartland of the Pergamene kingdom as well as the territories of Mysia, Lydia, Ionia, Caria, western Phrygia and the eastern Aegean islands. Under Augustus in 27 BCE Asia was declared a senatorial province and the governance of a proconsul. The capital of the province was Ephesos, although Pergamon may have fulfilled this role initially. Under Diocletian (284-305 CE) the province was subdivided into smaller administrative units: Hellespontus, Asia, Lydia, Caria, Phrygia I and Phrygia II. Due to its excellent harbors on the west coast and its many navigable rivers, Asia’s water-borne trade with the rest of the Mediterranean flourished. In the second century CE Asia experienced great prosperity, to which the growth and architectural aggrandizement of many of its cities attest. In the area of Kibyra, bordering the regions of Lycia, Caria, Phrygia and Pisidia, numerous inscriptions refer to the large imperial estates of Roman families. Woolen textiles, marble, and timber constituted a significant part of the commodities exported from the province.
While the Romans might have looked to the Greeks for inspiration in philosophy, architecture, sculpture, and the fine arts, the non-Greek peoples of the eastern Mediterranean are their inspiration for luxury, fine-living, and the status conferred by displays of individual wealth (Ath. Deip. 15.690). Asia was a center for such splendor, first in the kingdoms of Lydia, Phrygia, and Lycia, and then continued by the Persian satraps, and later the Hellenistic kings. The Persian paradeisos is particularly well attested in literature referencing Asia. That these gardens are known primarily from Roman-period literary sources indicates their continuing influence. For example, long after the gold of Lydia’s Pactolus River had disappeared, Lydia remained a literary topos, not only for copious wealth, but for a life of luxury set in a landscape of natural abundance. Athenaeus (Deip. 12.515d-f) wrote in the second century CE that
 &amp;quot;The Lydians in their luxury planned parks and made them like gardens and so kept in the shade. For they thought it more dainty not to have the sun’s rays touch them at all&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
 Other districts of Asia captured the Roman imagination: Pliny the Elder writes of an ancient plane tree (Sycamorus orientalis) in Lycia with a girth of sufficient circumference to house a grotto in its hollow trunk, ornamented with pumice and moss with provisions for 18 people to dine there (Plin. HN 12.5).
The paradeisoi of the Persian satraps are of particular influence on the introduction of horti and gardens of Rome. The paradeisos, from the Persian, paira daeza, or “enclosed place,” is a term that had evolved by the Hellenistic period to mean a large enclosed park with luxurious gardens as well as orchards, collections of trees, crops, and hunting areas. It was at Sardis that the Greek Lysander visited Cyrus the Younger, a visit recorded by Klearchos and retold by Xenophon. It is an essential moment in garden history recounted for the Romans by Cicero (Sen. 59). These paradeisoi, in the sense of luxurious orchards, are said by the Romans to have been brought to Greece by Kimon (Aristotole apud Plut. Cim. 10; cf. Cic. de Off. 2.64), and were adopted by Hellenistic kings throughout Greece and southern Italy during the late Hellenistic period. The hunting parks at Daskyleion and Celenae are also vividly described by Xenophon (see An. 1.2.7, 2.4.14 and Oec. 4.13). Xenophon also describes how paradeisoi were occupied or cut down by armies during the fourth and third centuries BCE. Appreciation for these parks apparently continued, and Seleucus of Syria took over the royal paradeisos at Sardis (Plut. Dem. 50). Years of instability followed, so it is difficult to know what the Romans themselves thought of paradeisoi in Asia in the second and first centuries BCE. Notable examples of paradeisoi, in some form, may have been visible to Romans visiting Asia, as well. For example, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus is now thought by its excavators to have been set in a grove or park.
Thus, the paradeisos, the alsos, the gymnasium, and the quadriporticus are not forms the Romans suddenly “discovered.” They had had a long influence and were integrated into the Hellenistic architectural forms of the Italic landscape. In the second century BCE, however, when the Roman generals began to define themselves as rulers of an empire, they turned directly to the palaces and paradeisoi of the Hellenistic monarchs to establish their power, to display spoils of war, and to create the luxurious setting for life in Rome. They further adapted the evolving quadriporticus form for display to the public
Despite the importance of Asia Minor in the history of the Roman landscape, archaeological evidence is scant. The excavators contacted for the gardens of this region indicated that parks, gardens, and other planted areas have yet to become a subject of research design for the region and finds appear to be few — primarily inscriptions and wall paintings. Most of the smaller domestic courtyards — often the most manageable to investigate — are paved. The larger palaestrae, gymnasia, and enclosed open spaces have not been investigated for landscape architectural and planting features, although recently an important campaign of work in the South Agora at Aphrodisias is setting an important precedent (CROSS-REF). The gardens included in this province include areas with dirt and incomplete paved surfaces, as well as sites where the excavators have some level of optimism that future study may yet reveal more about gardens. The subject of designed landscapes, gardens, and planted areas in Asia Minor remains in its archaeological infancy.

Keywords  stelae funerals watercourses vineyards groves (plant communities) Ulmus (genus) woodlands (plant communities) buildings (structures) wall tombs inscription Athenaeus Pliny the Elder Cicero Aristotle Plutarch quadriportici palaestrae gymnasiums  Garden Description A large stele of light grey marble inscribed on both sides and found in 1965 lying in a field between Akhisar (Thyateira) and Kirkağuç (Nakrason) in the border land between Lydia and Mysia records the final part (perhaps second half) of the will of a certain Epikrates, the son of Epikrates, from Thyateira, establishing a foundation to provide commemorative funerary rites for his son Diophantos, also from Thyateira. The detailed provisions of the will, which include specific topographical indications for the disposition of various productive properties to support the foundation, reveal a network of watercourses, vineyards, olive groves, cultivated fields, and open land in which a funerary grove (alsos) is set aside for Diophantos and another exception is made for “the garden in which my mother Tertia and my maternal uncle Secundus are buried” (κήπου, ἐν ᾦ τέθαπται Τερτία μου ἡ μήτηρ καὶ ὁ πρὸς μητρὸς θεῖος Σεκοῦνδος, lines 90-91). Two of the nearby properties are identified with toponyms, the “Elm Grove” (Πτελεών, lines 16, 18, 30) and the “Brickworks” (Πλινθούλκιον, line 28), which suggest productive areas comprising woodlands and claybeds as well as cultivated plots. The funerary complex described by Epikrates included buildings (οἰκοδομήματα, line 47), surrounding walls (περικείμενοι τοῖχοι, line 47), and the tomb of Diophantos, destined eventually to house the remains also of Epikrates and other members of his family (lines 76-79). The male line of the clan (Epikrates, Epikrates, and Diophantos) proclaimed its Greek ethnicity in its nomenclature, but the women of the family—his mother Tertia (sister of Secundus), his wife Laevilla, his daughter Tertia, and his granddaughter Cestia—all bore Roman names. Such mixed marriages of local male élites and women from the families of the Roman governing class (or, eventually, simply bearing Roman names) are characteristic of the provincial aristocracy of Asia Minor during the first century, the period to which, on the basis of its vocabulary and lettering, the inscribed testament of Epikrates belongs.

      <description>Province Asia
Province Description The region of what is now modern Turkey became a part of the Roman Empire in 133 BCE, when king Attalos III of Pergamum bequeathed his kingdom to the Roman people. The province included the heartland of the Pergamene kingdom as well as the territories of Mysia, Lydia, Ionia, Caria, western Phrygia and the eastern Aegean islands. Under Augustus in 27 BCE Asia was declared a senatorial province and the governance of a proconsul. The capital of the province was Ephesos, although Pergamon may have fulfilled this role initially. Under Diocletian (284-305 CE) the province was subdivided into smaller administrative units: Hellespontus, Asia, Lydia, Caria, Phrygia I and Phrygia II. Due to its excellent harbors on the west coast and its many navigable rivers, Asia’s water-borne trade with the rest of the Mediterranean flourished. In the second century CE Asia experienced great prosperity, to which the growth and architectural aggrandizement of many of its cities attest. In the area of Kibyra, bordering the regions of Lycia, Caria, Phrygia and Pisidia, numerous inscriptions refer to the large imperial estates of Roman families. Woolen textiles, marble, and timber constituted a significant part of the commodities exported from the province.
While the Romans might have looked to the Greeks for inspiration in philosophy, architecture, sculpture, and the fine arts, the non-Greek peoples of the eastern Mediterranean are their inspiration for luxury, fine-living, and the status conferred by displays of individual wealth (Ath. Deip. 15.690). Asia was a center for such splendor, first in the kingdoms of Lydia, Phrygia, and Lycia, and then continued by the Persian satraps, and later the Hellenistic kings. The Persian paradeisos is particularly well attested in literature referencing Asia. That these gardens are known primarily from Roman-period literary sources indicates their continuing influence. For example, long after the gold of Lydia’s Pactolus River had disappeared, Lydia remained a literary topos, not only for copious wealth, but for a life of luxury set in a landscape of natural abundance. Athenaeus (Deip. 12.515d-f) wrote in the second century CE that
 &amp;quot;The Lydians in their luxury planned parks and made them like gardens and so kept in the shade. For they thought it more dainty not to have the sun’s rays touch them at all&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
 Other districts of Asia captured the Roman imagination: Pliny the Elder writes of an ancient plane tree (Sycamorus orientalis) in Lycia with a girth of sufficient circumference to house a grotto in its hollow trunk, ornamented with pumice and moss with provisions for 18 people to dine there (Plin. HN 12.5).
The paradeisoi of the Persian satraps are of particular influence on the introduction of horti and gardens of Rome. The paradeisos, from the Persian, paira daeza, or “enclosed place,” is a term that had evolved by the Hellenistic period to mean a large enclosed park with luxurious gardens as well as orchards, collections of trees, crops, and hunting areas. It was at Sardis that the Greek Lysander visited Cyrus the Younger, a visit recorded by Klearchos and retold by Xenophon. It is an essential moment in garden history recounted for the Romans by Cicero (Sen. 59). These paradeisoi, in the sense of luxurious orchards, are said by the Romans to have been brought to Greece by Kimon (Aristotole apud Plut. Cim. 10; cf. Cic. de Off. 2.64), and were adopted by Hellenistic kings throughout Greece and southern Italy during the late Hellenistic period. The hunting parks at Daskyleion and Celenae are also vividly described by Xenophon (see An. 1.2.7, 2.4.14 and Oec. 4.13). Xenophon also describes how paradeisoi were occupied or cut down by armies during the fourth and third centuries BCE. Appreciation for these parks apparently continued, and Seleucus of Syria took over the royal paradeisos at Sardis (Plut. Dem. 50). Years of instability followed, so it is difficult to know what the Romans themselves thought of paradeisoi in Asia in the second and first centuries BCE. Notable examples of paradeisoi, in some form, may have been visible to Romans visiting Asia, as well. For example, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus is now thought by its excavators to have been set in a grove or park.
Thus, the paradeisos, the alsos, the gymnasium, and the quadriporticus are not forms the Romans suddenly “discovered.” They had had a long influence and were integrated into the Hellenistic architectural forms of the Italic landscape. In the second century BCE, however, when the Roman generals began to define themselves as rulers of an empire, they turned directly to the palaces and paradeisoi of the Hellenistic monarchs to establish their power, to display spoils of war, and to create the luxurious setting for life in Rome. They further adapted the evolving quadriporticus form for display to the public
Despite the importance of Asia Minor in the history of the Roman landscape, archaeological evidence is scant. The excavators contacted for the gardens of this region indicated that parks, gardens, and other planted areas have yet to become a subject of research design for the region and finds appear to be few — primarily inscriptions and wall paintings. Most of the smaller domestic courtyards — often the most manageable to investigate — are paved. The larger palaestrae, gymnasia, and enclosed open spaces have not been investigated for landscape architectural and planting features, although recently an important campaign of work in the South Agora at Aphrodisias is setting an important precedent (CROSS-REF). The gardens included in this province include areas with dirt and incomplete paved surfaces, as well as sites where the excavators have some level of optimism that future study may yet reveal more about gardens. The subject of designed landscapes, gardens, and planted areas in Asia Minor remains in its archaeological infancy.

Cypress trees are specifically mentioned, and it was unlawful to cut them down or remove wood from the sanctuary. In the mid-first century B.C., however, a Roman prefect by the name of Turullius felled trees in the sanctuary to acquire timber for building ships. Caesar had him executed for this offence (Cassius Dio 51.8.3; Valerius Maximus 1.1.19).

Keywords  [triclinium] [oecus] [portico] [trapezophron] [puteal] [pergola]   Garden Description 545.IV.21 A. Of all the houses that overlooked the Bay on the south edge of the city, this house excavated in 1929-1932 was the most elegant. The triclinium(b) on the north was on an axis through the spacious garden with the large oecus(c) on the south, dividing the garden (a) into two large rectangular beds. The garden was enclosed on the west, north and east by a corridor with windows replacing an earlier portico. Statues that had been displaced by the mud flow to the center of the garden would have stood on either side of the passageway. This collection was the most valuable found in Herculaneum and reflects the patrician culture of this house. These pieces included two groups of stags attacked by hounds (Herculaneum inv. nos. 519, 524), a satyr with a wineskin (Herculaneum inv. no. 520), and a drunken Hercules (Herculaneum inv. no. 525). The satyr pouring from a wineskin is a variation of the well-known bronze found in the House of the Centenary of Pompeii and was a fountain statuette, but Maiuri believed that it had not been installed at the time of the eruption. Other items found in the center of the garden were a trapezophron, a cup and a marble puteal. There were four small marble bases in the south half of the garden set in the soil which probably once held marble herms that were removed by the Bourbons. The terrace yielded a statuette of the boy Eros (Herculaneum inv. no. 2077) and the pieces of another similar statuette. A gutter around the edge of the garden carried roof water to the cistern and the puteal over the cistern opening in the west end of the north gutter was deeply worn by ropes. A view of the sea could be enjoyed from a vantage point in the triclinium on the north across the garden and through the grand oecus which would have served as a triclinium in the summer. Beyond the oecus was a pergola and Jashemski noted that four original terra-cotta pots found by the pergola pillars were the most decorative she had seen. These would have been planted with a display for the pergola
546-547.IV.21. B. and C. On either side of the pergola was a small garden (d)and (e) with an elegant room on the far side with a window to look out to the garden and a second window looking to the sea. The statuettes of Eros may have originally been placed in these rooms, swept away by the mud flow from the eruption.

Keywords  triclinium nymphaeum amphora  Garden Description 550.V.6/7 To the very back of this house, excavated in 1932-1936, there was a small courtyard (a) that served as a garden having a summer triclinium and garden paintings on the walls. It was converted into a beautiful nymphaeum and at that time a mosaic panel was created featuring Neptune and Amphitrite positioned on the rear wall where it could be seen immediately upon entering the house. On either side of the mosaic a garden painting on a red background featured the typical lattice fence forming an apse in which a round fountain stands on a pedestal. In the right side panel there is a large tree growing in the center of the background surrounded by oleanders and myrtles with petite white flowers. Many birds are seen flying, perched on the rim of the fountain or walking along the top of the fence. A garland of ivy frames the top of the panel. The panel on the left sustained extensive damage but enough plaster survived to suggest this panel was similar. The garden painting continues on the adjacent south wall for a short length. Two other garden panels were located on the north end of the west wall and on the adjacent north wall. These contained the same lattice fence painted on a blue-green background with a red border. Any further detail had been ruined by the time of excavation. The architectural façade of a detailed nymphaeum was built on the north wall and decorated with shells and mosaics. A small rectangular niche on either side of the central arched niche had a small column of cipolin (marble)which could have held lamps standing on a base of red marble. The central niche had a base which would have likely been for a fountain statuette, although no evidence of piping was found. Above each of the rectangular niches there is a mosaic panel of a deer being chased by a hound with a peacock perched on a robust garland overhead. Above these panels are two tragic masks on the outsides and a comic mask in the center, and a head of Silenus on the wall above all else. The triclinium in the center of the courtyard is very low and had white marble facing on the couches and marble paving between them. A small column decorated with ivy leaves and berries stood between the couches with a channel for a water pipe in the center. This could have held a bowl for a fountain, as Maiuri observed the same was painted on the east wall. A marble slab closed the mouth of a cistern with the neck of an amphora, with a terra-cotta stopper, installed to drain off any excess water.

Keywords  textrina portico puteal  Garden Description 548.V.4/3. There was a courtyard (a) in the center of this house which was apparently attached to a textrina. The courtyard was surrounded by a portico with seven supporting brick columns. These were connected by a low wall and a second wall on the inside was slightly lower and formed a gutter. A terra-cotta puteal was located by the entrance on the north over the cistern opening. Maiuri concluded there was enough soil present here to indicate this had been a garden.

##Jashemski Catalogue 537.III.11.
Keywords  loggia triclinium  Garden Description 537.III.11. Casa del Tramezzo di Legno The excavation of this house was begun in 1869-1875, but the excavation of the garden and restoration of the house was completed in the time period from January 1928 to December 1929. A wide opening on the west offered a view of the garden from the triclinium(b) directly across the way. A narrow storeroom (c) on the south had a small loggiasupported by slender columns overhead which provided a view down into the garden. The south garden wall was decorated with a garden painting. A combination of the painting’s poor condition and the artist’s strange sense of perspective caused difficulty ininterpretation. The typical lattice fence would appear to recede to form an apse for the fountain, however the lattice is painted over the fountain, a robust bowl-shaped affair, making it appear neither in front nor in back. An arbor was perhaps included,but the plaster was extensively damaged in this area. The birds were unusual, a small light colored bird perched on the right rim of the fountain was unable to be identified and on each side of the fountain at the base was a large sleepy duck (Anas sp.).A small slender heron on the right is picking at a snake. Beyond the fence various indistinct shrubs are painted on a yellow background. Between the two east pillars of the north wall the cisternmouth received water collected by the gutter which ran around the perimeter of the garden.

##Jashemski Catalogue 536.III.3.
Keywords  aedicules tympanum pergola amorino  Garden Description The small light well of this house had once been occupied by a pool. By the time of the eruption it had been filled with soil and converted to a small garden (a). During this change an aedicula was built on a high podium against the back wall, decorated with mosaic and shells, and garden paintings were added to the light well walls. The walls on the east and south had panels framed on the top and sides with a wide red band and a smaller black one inside. The south wall had panels on both sides of the mosaic aedicule, and of all the panels, the left panel of the south wall was the best preserved, although the GARDENS OF THE ROMAN EMPIREITALIA2center third is missing. In this panel the lattice fence is evident and a tympanumis suspended form the center of the top. This panel also has traces of what could have been a trellised pergola just to the left of the aedicula. The garden in the background is filled with densely planted bushes and a bird is perched on a branch on either edge of the panel. A masonry base was uncovered in the pool which had at one time supported a fountain jet or statuette. The excavation was begun in 1830-1831, resumed in 1869-1871, and completed in 1927. The niche of the aedecula shrine was decorated with a cluster of acanthus leaves with a female face in the center. A small roof was set in the wall to protect the painting and above this was a marble relief of an amorino flying to the left carrying a filled money purse. An iron grate was built over the top of this light well to prevent intruders from gaining access from the neighbor’s roofs. To the north was an apsed room which gained light and air from this area.

Keywords  atrium triclinium procoeton  Garden Description 542.IV.3-4. A. Two separate dwellings were united to form this house, excavated in 1928-1929. The northern house has three courtyards. The first (a) is directly off of the vestibule, the second is a covered atrium(b) with a small courtyard that collected roof water, and the third courtyard (c) in the rear supplied light and air to the adjoining rooms and the triclinium. This was too badly damaged to ascertain if it was a garden or even if it once held potted plants. It was compared to the better preserved courtyard in the Casa a Graticcio by Maiuri.
543.IV.3-4. B. The more elegant dwelling to the south had a long corridor on one side of the large triclinium leading to a small paved courtyard with pillars (e) which supplied light and air to the house. The pillars on the south and east stood on a low wall, 0.80 m. high, with a planting area 15 cm. wide in between. This gives the area the feeling of window boxes placed below large windows. There was a well in the southeast corner of this courtyard which received rain water and beyond the courtyard was a secluded alcove. This consisted of an apsed room preceded by a procoeton.

Keywords  sacellum portico opus reticulatum  Garden Description 539.III.17. At the rear of this small house there was a courtyard with an impressive brick altar against the rear wall. Maiuri felt this was probably a roofed area which would have been a sacellum. This area was excavated in 1927-1929 and may have held a few potted plants.
540.III.19-18/1-2 Because it was one of the largest houses in Herculaneum commanding a fine view of the Bay, it was initially thought that this residence was a hotel when it was excavated between the years of 1835 to 1855. The large garden (a) was also mistaken for a poultry yard but the discovery of the carbonized trunk of a pear tree (Pyrus communis L.) would indicate this area could have been planted in fruit trees. A portico surrounded the garden eight steps (1.10) above the garden level while the gutter ran one step below the portico and at each corner there was a shallow square basin for purifying the household water. The gutter conveyed the rain water to a cistern below the two wells, the openings of which were located between the columns in the middle of the east and west walls. A low masonry wall of opus reticulatum which went between the columns was a later addition. The garden was entered by way of masonry steps in the center of the south side.

##Jashemski Catalogue 541.IV.1-2
Keywords  portico exedra triclinium  Garden Description 541.IV.1-2 A windowed portico surrounded this garden (a) on the north, south and west. The east side was bordered by a narrow corridor which Maiuri proposed had glass in woodenframes set on the outside edge of the low wall. This wall had a planting space 0.16 m. wide in the top next to where the windows were set, creating a greenhouse environment. This luxurious house had an exedra(b) opening onto the center of the corridor and looking into the garden, which was slightly lower. On the oppositeside,the walls, columns, and the door posts were decorated with paintingsof shrubs, grapevines, ivy andoleander in flower as a continuation of the garden proper. A gutter circled the perimeter of the garden except by the entrance on the south, which was directly across from the grand triclinium-oecus(c). A rectangular marble-edged pool in the center of the garden had a water jet which could be viewed from either the exedra or the triclinium. The excavations in this garden in 1929-1930 uncovered a spherical white marble sundial. The triclinium-oecus opened to the south onto a long covered portico with an open terrace (d) beyond that looking out over the Bay. Potted plants most likely were placed here.

Keywords  [impluvium] [atrium] [peristyle] [viridarium]   Garden Description 552.V.30. A shallow cruciform-shaped impluvium was the central feature in the rectangular atrium of this house excavated in 1933-1934. The atrium gave the impression of a peristyle garden by way of the fountain centered in the impluvium, the plantings on either side and three tuffa columns on either side, fluted white stucco on the top and painted red at the base. These were connected by a low wall with plantings on the top creating a lush green atmosphere to the total effect. This arrangement was the result of the aqueduct supplying an abundance of water and reducing the demand on the cistern, which was found in the northeast corner of the garden, and the ancient well incorporated into the low wall. This house was noted by Maiuri as an elegant example of the transformation of the impluvium basin into a fountain and viridarium.

Keywords  cisterns (plumbing components) triclinium peristyles porticoes gutters (building drainage components)  Garden Description 533.II.2. A. The earliest excavations of Herculaneum were done with underground tunnels. Several of these crossed this site and were discovered sixty three years later when further excavation of this patrician house was conducted in1828-1835. Eight brick columns and one engaged column stood on each of the long sides of the portico that bounded the large peristyle garden (a) on the east, north, and west sides. The north side was supported by four more columns and at the two front corners there was a pillar with an engaged column on each side. In the center of the north side two smaller pillars with one engaged column each framed a garden view from the triclinium. All the supporting members were coated with fine stucco. Gutters ringing the garden conveyed rain water to the cistern.
534.II.2. B. A second peristyle garden was located to the west of the first, but has only been partially excavated. It has stuccoed columns and pillars joined by a wall 0.4 m. high painted with plants and flowers.

A section of the northeast portico was not excavated until 1930. The courtyard measured 15.75 x 25.25 m. and was bounded by the portico on the west, north and east sides. Engaged columns stood along the south. This area was likely planted after the palestra was built. Although the original excavators labeled this as a garden, no detailed observations were recorded to confirm this supposition.

Above the planting bed, traces of garden paintings could be seen. The only records of these paintings are reports from those present at the time of excavation. Mau relates that the paintings consisted of a lattice fence with plants above. There were two openings depicted in the fence on the on the east wall, the one on the left 0.95 m and the one on the right 1.15 m. Each opening had plants and a vessel, the one on the left was bottle-shaped and silver colored and the one on the right was goblet-shaped and gold colored. Jashemski notes that these vessels probably represented fountains. Sogliano commented that the garden had representations of xenia.

Between the garden wall and the wall of the house a gutter was formed which directed the roof run off into a cistern. A marble garden herm was found on the low wall with the head of a satyr sporting goat’s ears and ram’s horns (0.20 high). In the center of the garden stood a masonry triclinium (l. medius, 4.00 m.; l. imus and. summus 3.75 m.) decorated with plants painted on a yellow background, a masonry table with a colored marble top (090 x 1.50 m.) sat between the couches. Excavators reported the post holes for the pergola were reinforced with potsherds to bolster the posts. The south and west walls were lined with cavities (the dimensions were not recorded) that were centered in soil depressions to hold water. In the northwest corner of the garden a masonry altar sat in front of an arched niche.

Keywords  gutters (building drainage components) cisterns (plumbing components) triclinia (couches) trellises altars (religious fixtures) lararia  Garden Description This house with an unusual design had a garden (a) in the rear southwest corner that was separated from a courtyard to the north by a low masonry wall. Between the garden wall and the wall of the house a gutter was formed which directed the roof run off into a cistern. A marble garden herm was found on the low wall with the head of a satyr sporting goat’s ears and ram’s horns (0.20 high). In the center of the garden stood a masonry triclinium (l. medius, 4.00 m.; l. imus and. summus 3.75 m.) decorated with plants painted on a yellow background, a masonry table with a colored marble top (090 x 1.50 m.) sat between the couches. Excavators reported the post holes for the pergola were reinforced with potsherds to bolster the posts. The south and west walls were lined with cavities (the dimensions were not recorded) that were centered in soil depressions to hold water. In the northwest corner of the garden a masonry altar sat in front of an arched niche.

Keywords  tablina peristyles (Roman courtyards) porticoes predellas lararia fountains  Garden Description B. At the rear of this house a peristyle garden (b) was bordered on the south by a portico. Three columns and an engaged column, stuccoed and fluted on the top, red at the bottom, supported the portico. A large animal painting occupied three walls of the peristyle garden with a bold checkerboard above and a black dado at the base painted with stylized plants and flowers. The west wall featured a garden representation on the predella. The garden is entered through a tall portal with a round oscillum suspended beneath a crater-shaped vase on the top of the entry. The front fence forms an excedra on either side of the entrance and shrubbery painted in green is shown along the front. Garden representations cover the entire dado (0.55 x 3.50 m.) of both the north and south walls of the tablinium. On a black background a garden is enclosed by an elaborate fence that suggests marble with a curvilinear and rectilinear design. The garden on the north wall a large semicircle in the center has a footed circular fountain with a water jet in the center, the water falling in two streams. The south wall has a crater-shaped fountain in an angular niche. Flowers bloom in lavender and white while birds sit on the fence in both paintings. A white flower garland graces the base of the paintings and traces of a schola are visible on the north wall.

A cistern had been walled up and the garden was built over the cistern mouth and a paved courtyard. Water from the neighbor’s roof (no.13) supplied the cistern. The east and south walls once had garden paintings, and from the entrance the garden could be viewed through a window in the tablinium. The painting on the east wall was visible from the entrance and continued not only on the south wall but additionally on the pillar to the northeast. According to the excavator’s reports the painting had a lattice fence at the base with a variety of tall, bushy plants and birds throughout. There was a marble basin with a bearded sphinx above, reposing with the profile turned to the left. At the extreme left of the east wall was a niche that most likely had been a lararium (Fig.25, 48.1.61).

Keywords  [viridarium] cisterns (plumbing components) mural paintings (visual works) tablina trellises lararia  Garden Description Wooden steps at the rear of this house excavated in 1902 led up to a viridarium (a) confined by a low masonry wall. A cistern had been walled up and the garden was built over the cistern mouth and a paved courtyard. Water from the neighbor’s roof (no.13) supplied the cistern. The east and south walls once had garden paintings, and from the entrance the garden could be viewed through a window in the tablinium. The painting on the east wall was visible from the entrance and continued not only on the south wall but additionally on the pillar to the northeast. According to the excavator’s reports the painting had a lattice fence at the base with a variety of tall, bushy plants and birds throughout. There was a marble basin with a bearded sphinx above, reposing with the profile turned to the left. At the extreme left of the east wall was a niche that most likely had been a lararium (Fig.25, 48.1.61).

      <description>Province Africa proconsularis(Pleiades)
Province Description The history of Roman Africa begins in 146 BC with the destruction of Carthage and the establishment of the province of Africa in the most fertile part of the Carthaginian Empire. The new province covered about 5000 square miles (17,172 square kilometers) of the northern part of modern Tunisia. A praetor governed the area from his headquarters at Utica. The Romans inherited a thriving agriculture developed by the Carthaginians. The climate was hospitable. Wheat and barley were the most important cereals; wine and olive oil were also produced and there were various fruit trees.
Location UTICA (Utique) Tunisia(Pleiades)
Location Description Her geographic situation made of Utica one of the oldest and well-known Phoenician settlements. In 146 B.C, Utica became the capital of the newly created province of Africa and the residence of the governor. With the triumph of Caesar and the resurgence of Carthage, Utica&amp;rsquo;s supremacy would gradually decline under the empire. In 36 B.C. it became a municipium and a colony under Hadrian.
The city was laid out on a grid plan. Numerous buildings have been uncovered, among them the forum, several temples and baths, an amphitheater, a circus, and opulent houses. Many of these buildings of the Republican period were, during the imperial era, replaced by others larger and more luxurious. This explains the existence of two theaters for example, the one fitted into the side of the hill, the other built in open country. Enormous cisterns were constructed, fed by an aqueduct. Still extant on the summit of the acropolis overlooking the town, is a quadrangular edifice habitually referred to as “the citadel,” which could perhaps be simply a water tower.
Garden House H (Maison H)
Keywords  semicircular mosaics  Garden Description This house, the largest in insula III (lots 2,3,4,9,10), rivals the House of the Cascade in size and richness of mosaics (Plan view, Fig.1). A semicircular basin extended into the garden on the S and E sides, each decorated with a marine scene.

Location THYSDRUS (El Jem) Tunisia(Pleiades)
Location Description Thysdrus is located on the western border of the Sahel at 60 km S of Hadrumetum on the road leading to Sfax. The development, from the end of the 2d c., of its olive plantations and its trade in oil made the fortune of the city.
The name appeared for the first time in the period of Caesar&amp;rsquo;s African campaign when the city, at the time a small town, took side with the Pompeian and Juba against Ceasar. Towards the end of the 2d c. it became a municipium, competing with Hadrumetum for the second place in the province. The decline of Thysdrus began when, involved in a political crisis, the city choose the side of Gordian proconsul of Africa against the Emperor Maximianus. The joint effects of the political disgrace and the economic crisis, which resulted from it, brought an end to its development. By the end of the IVth century it was scarcely mentioned by the Catholic and Donatist bishops.
Among the most remarkable monuments of the ancient city are the best preserved large amphitheater in Africa, the small amphitheater located some 7.20 m to the S of the large one, the circus better visible on an aerial photography, the baths covering a surface of 2400 sq., and the residential district bounded on the S by a necropolis and to the E by a fine street.

Keywords  peristyle semicircular  Garden Description This vast house (3000 m2) was laid out around a peristyle garden (Plan view, Fig.1). The sunken garden was enclosed by a low wall that curved to form a semi-circular basin in-between the third and fourth column to which was adjoined a euripus at the end of which a rectangular platform supported either a sculpture or a fountain.
Dates the beginning of the IIIrd century.

Location UTHINA (Oudna) Tunisia(Pleiades)
Location Description Uthina was a town in the province of Africa Proconsularis, now northern Tunisia. Uthina became a Roman colony of veterans of Legio XIII Gemina during the reign of Emperor Augustus. Hence, it was mentioned by Ptolemy (IV, 3, 34), Pliny the Elder, and the Tabula Peutingeriana.
From the accounts given by geographers the site seems to be the ruins that form the archeological site of Oudna, near a station on the railway from Tunis to Kef and not far from what was the World War II Oudna Airfield. These ruins occupy a surface nearly three miles in circumference, covering a hilly plateau, and commanding the left bank of the Milian wady; there are remains of a fortress, cisterns, an aqueduct, a triumphal arch, a theatre, an amphitheater, a basilica with a circular crypt, and a bridge. Many mosaics are to be found there as well.

Keywords  peristyle niches  Garden Description The peristyle garden enclosed by a portico on four sides had a long basin, which was concave at one end, and had semicircular and rectangular niches. It occupied the central axis of the garden. The bottom was paved with mosaic. The semicircular pool extending into the garden on the E side was also decorated with niches.
Dates the II-III century.

Twenty-four Corinthian columns that may have reached 3m high, supported a portico on four sides. On the North, the South and the West, the peristyle is surrounded by rooms and apartments, some with their own colonnaded courtyards paved with mosaics (pseudo-atria). The Eastern portico, because of the declivity of the land was constructed on vaults. It probably opened on the exterior by a colonnade that allowed the visitor to admire the sea, the mountains and the valley of Oued Zaghouan. A small wooden fence enclosed the garden except in front of the vestibule and the oecus, from the vestibule one could traverse the garden and enter the oecus, without having to use the porticoes. At a later phase these entries were closed by a basin and cistern. The garden had in its center a rectangular basin, of which only the foundation was found.

Garden House of the Cascade (Maison de la Cascade)
Keywords  masonry triclinium baroque cascade  Garden Description This house, the largest in the insula II (lots 2,3,8,9,10), was given its present form in the second century. A large peristyle with elaborate viridarium dominated the S part of the house (Plan view, Fig.1). The large shallow pool in the center of the garden occupied a rectangular area that was largely filled by a huge marble-faced masonry construction with semicircular and rectangular niches that gave the pool a baroque shape. The marble-faced construction probably held an important sculpture. Water from the fountain jet spilled from the marble-lined channel cut into the base and then spilled into the pool. The sundial, today at the edge of the base of the pool, is not in its original position.
Extending into the garden from the two central columns on the N was a semicircular pool (which faced the large room (XXXIV), decorated with a well preserved mosaic showing an Eros fishing from a boat, surrounded by fish and other sea animals. A wide entrance on the E side of the garden led through the portico to the handsome triclinium, by far the largest room in the house.
Opening off of the triclinium to the S was a smaller area enclosed by a portico on three sides. The dominant feature was the shallow square basin (1.92x 1.2 m) decorated with a fish mosaic and the adjacent mosaic panel from which the house is named. In the cascade panel, two fishermen are pulling in a vast net full of fish and sea animals. The soil on each side of the cascade was probably planted.

      <description>Province Africa proconsularis(Pleiades)
Province Description The history of Roman Africa begins in 146 BC with the destruction of Carthage and the establishment of the province of Africa in the most fertile part of the Carthaginian Empire. The new province covered about 5000 square miles (17,172 square kilometers) of the northern part of modern Tunisia. A praetor governed the area from his headquarters at Utica. The Romans inherited a thriving agriculture developed by the Carthaginians. The climate was hospitable. Wheat and barley were the most important cereals; wine and olive oil were also produced and there were various fruit trees.
Location THYSDRUS (El Jem) Tunisia(Pleiades)
Location Description Thysdrus is located on the western border of the Sahel at 60 km S of Hadrumetum on the road leading to Sfax. The development, from the end of the 2d c., of its olive plantations and its trade in oil made the fortune of the city.
The name appeared for the first time in the period of Caesar&amp;rsquo;s African campaign when the city, at the time a small town, took side with the Pompeian and Juba against Ceasar. Towards the end of the 2d c. it became a municipium, competing with Hadrumetum for the second place in the province. The decline of Thysdrus began when, involved in a political crisis, the city choose the side of Gordian proconsul of Africa against the Emperor Maximianus. The joint effects of the political disgrace and the economic crisis, which resulted from it, brought an end to its development. By the end of the IVth century it was scarcely mentioned by the Catholic and Donatist bishops.
Among the most remarkable monuments of the ancient city are the best preserved large amphitheater in Africa, the small amphitheater located some 7.20 m to the S of the large one, the circus better visible on an aerial photography, the baths covering a surface of 2400 sq., and the residential district bounded on the S by a necropolis and to the E by a fine street.
Garden House of the Dolphins (Maison des dauphins)
Keywords  column porticos aedicula  Garden Description The vast house (3000-3500 m2) is laid out around a large peristyle garden (Plan view, Fig.1). The large sunken garden (X, 16 x 16.25 m) was enclosed by a low wall (0.70 m high) and had a large semicircular basin (dia. 3.10 m) between the fifth and the sixth column facing a reception room (XXV). A rectangular aedicula with four columns facing the oecus (XXXVII) extended in the garden on the W.

With the triumph of Caesar and the resurgence of Carthage, Utica&amp;rsquo;s supremacy would gradually decline under the empire. In 36 B.C. it became a municipium and a colony under Hadrian.
The city was laid out on a grid plan. Numerous buildings have been uncovered, among them the forum, several temples and baths, an amphitheater, a circus, and opulent houses. Many of these buildings of the Republican period were, during the imperial era, replaced by others larger and more luxurious. This explains the existence of two theaters for example, the one fitted into the side of the hill, the other built in open country. Enormous cisterns were constructed, fed by an aqueduct. Still extant on the summit of the acropolis overlooking the town, is a quadrangular edifice habitually referred to as “the citadel,” which could perhaps be simply a water tower.
Garden House of the Figured Basins (Maison aux bassins figurés)
Keywords  semicircular geometric brim  Garden Description The house was located in the insula III. The rectangular courtyard, in the SW corner on the axis of the great hall (XI), paved during the last period may have been a garden earlier (Plan view, Fig.1). It had a semicircular basin with a geometric design in the bottom. The wall and the brim were figured.

When the house was substantially altered in the second century the enlargement of the curb on the adjoining well destroyed half of the basin. At the same time the oecus was subdivided into several rooms, courtyard was paved.

Location ALTHIBUROS (Médeïna) Tunisia(Pleiades)
Location Description This town is located on the road between Carthage and Theveste near the border of Proconsularis and Byzacena 35 km west of Mactar. Under the Roman Empire it remained an indigenous civitas until it was raised to the status of a municipium by Hadrian: municipium aelium hadrianum augustum althiburitanum and later was granted the ius Italicum.
The trade of agricultural products and craftsmanship made Althiburos a prosperous city, particularly, the fabrication and the commerce of aromatics. The development of the city reached its peak under the Antonian and Severian dynasties. It is difficult to follow the history of Althiburos during the third century when the province of Africa underwent the severe crisis of 238. The city was abandoned just before the Arab conquest. Excavations have brought to light the forum, the capitol, the Hadrianic triumphal arch and two temples. At the east corner of the forum, near one of the temples, was a complex of houses and a building with a rotonda to the south of which stood a monumental fountain. Outside the excavated center are other monuments, among them the theater and a triumphal arch.
Garden Asclepeia Building (Edifice des Asclepeia)
Keywords  Il Portico triclinium lararium foliage  Garden Description The Asklepeia monument, so-called from a mosaic inscription, is located to the northeast of the House of the Muses. (Plan view, Fig. 1)
This building is divided into three sections: the central building, the northeast sector and the private baths. The central building, probably a house, presents an architectural arrangement unusual in Africa. Strictly symmetrical in plan, the monument has a long gallery terminating at either end in two corner turrets. The facade has several windows on either side of an impressive entrance. This corridor opens onto a large square room flanked on either side by a square-shaped basin with a passageway running around it. This great vestibule views onto a peristyle garden (20.33x17.5m) equipped with a complete hydraulic system in the garden (167m2). Two large symmetrical oeci, along with their adjoining apartments, frame both sides of this peristyle.
The garden gradually changed during three phases of building renovation.
During the first phase, in the beginning of the third century, the garden was bordered by twenty columns and had a well (f) and two square shaped enclosures (e, h) from which water jets came out. One jetted towards the reception room (4) located near the entrance on the south and the other jetted symmetrically towards the reception room (23) on the north.
During the second phase, in the mid third century, the garden was enclosed by a balustrade and several water features were added: two semi-circular basins (c, d) symmetrical in shape and size – with a rectangular shape on the outside and semi-circular on the inside, each facing a reception room (28, 16). A shallow round pool that had the shape of a daisy with 49 petals was placed inside the N square enclosure (h) from which water was jetting. The well was later filled with soil and not used.
During this phase, a long rectangular basin was laid in front of the entrance of the house. The basin may have been bordered by a garden.
During the third stage dated to the beginning of the second half of the fourth century, the water features were modified and a large basin was added. Niches were added inside the semi-circular basins. In the center of the garden, a rectangular basin (g) (6.20x4.20m) that protruded onto the square basin (h) and enclosed a small rectangular basin (g) (0.15x0.15m) was added.

Keywords  Il Portico triclinium lararium foliage  Garden Description The house, noteworthy for its many and varied mosaic floors, is located on the right side of Oum El Abid river in a residential neighborhood. This vast domus is laid out around a peristyle onto which the rooms open. The courtyard (6.50 x 6.50 m) may have been planted (Plan view, Fig. 1). A long basin (4.15x 1.85; D. 0,72m.) was placed on the axis of the triclinium (G). Each end of the basin is curved to form a semi-circular pool.
The triclinium was bordered on two sides by two apartments that each had rooms and a corridor. The rooms to the north of the triclinium have an additional non-paved courtyard (L) enclosed by a colonnade closed by a balustrade. This lightwell may have been a small garden.

The city was laid out on a grid plan. Numerous buildings have been uncovered, among them the forum, several temples and baths, an amphitheater, a circus, and opulent houses. Many of these buildings of the Republican period were, during the imperial era, replaced by others larger and more luxurious. This explains the existence of two theaters for example, the one fitted into the side of the hill, the other built in open country. Enormous cisterns were constructed, fed by an aqueduct. Still extant on the summit of the acropolis overlooking the town, is a quadrangular edifice habitually referred to as “the citadel,” which could perhaps be simply a water tower.

      <description>Province Africa proconsularis(Pleiades)
Province Description The history of Roman Africa begins in 146 BC with the destruction of Carthage and the establishment of the province of Africa in the most fertile part of the Carthaginian Empire. The new province covered about 5000 square miles (17,172 square kilometers) of the northern part of modern Tunisia. A praetor governed the area from his headquarters at Utica. The Romans inherited a thriving agriculture developed by the Carthaginians. The climate was hospitable. Wheat and barley were the most important cereals; wine and olive oil were also produced and there were various fruit trees.
Location THYSDRUS (El Jem) Tunisia(Pleiades)
Location Description Thysdrus is located on the western border of the Sahel at 60 km S of Hadrumetum on the road leading to Sfax. The development, from the end of the 2d c., of its olive plantations and its trade in oil made the fortune of the city.
The name appeared for the first time in the period of Caesar&amp;rsquo;s African campaign when the city, at the time a small town, took side with the Pompeian and Juba against Ceasar. Towards the end of the 2d c. it became a municipium, competing with Hadrumetum for the second place in the province. The decline of Thysdrus began when, involved in a political crisis, the city choose the side of Gordian proconsul of Africa against the Emperor Maximianus. The joint effects of the political disgrace and the economic crisis, which resulted from it, brought an end to its development. By the end of the IVth century it was scarcely mentioned by the Catholic and Donatist bishops.
Among the most remarkable monuments of the ancient city are the best preserved large amphitheater in Africa, the small amphitheater located some 7.20 m to the S of the large one, the circus better visible on an aerial photography, the baths covering a surface of 2400 sq., and the residential district bounded on the S by a necropolis and to the E by a fine street.

Originally, the whole area was one house, called the House of the Fishpond (Maison au Vivier), which went through two phases. The space was then completely rearranged in a phase known as the House of the Large Gallery (Maison de la Grande Gallery), which was then transformed to its final state: the House of Sucellus to the west and the Edifice with Pillars to the east. The area was unearthed during a programmed excavation in 1990 and was found well preserved. The total surface area is about 2400 square meters.

The use of the space was completely inverted. Rooms were built on the filled-in garden, and the former house was torn down to become a garden. This new house continued to occupy the whole insula. No plan is available for this house, but the new eastern part would be practically completely preserved in the next house. To the east now extended the new garden, which may possibly have preserved three branches of the channel-pool of the earlier house.

Keywords  domus mosaics (visual works) courtyards peristyles (Roman courtyards) porticoes  House Description This house is today, as when it was built, only a few meters back from the right bank of the Rhone. It is now under the museum. It was completely uncovered in 1987 so that its lines might be respected in the building above it, and then covered over to protect it during construction. The museum sits above it on pilings so that at some future time the house can again be unearthed. It was built in the second century, covered a surface of more than 2500 square meters, and was occupied 100 to 150 years before being destroyed by the river. The name comes from a mosaic of a lion found in room [10] and now in the museum. The insula is separated into two parts by an east-west wall. It is difficult to determine whether the structures on either side are two halves of the same house or two different houses. However, the northern part was composed mainly of reception areas and lacked service rooms, so the assumption that it was somehow one house seems plausible.

      <description>Province Asia Asia (Pleiades)
Province description The region of what is now modern Turkey became a part of the Roman Empire in 133 B.C. when king Attalos III of Pergamum bequeathed his kingdom to the Roman people. The province included the heartland of the Pergamene kingdom as well as the territories of Mysia, Lydia, Ionia, Caria, western Phrygia and the eastern Aegean islands. Under Augustus in 27 B.C. Asia was declared a senatorial province and the governance of a proconsul. The capital of the province was Ephesos, although Pergamon may have fulfilled this role initially. Under Diocletian (284-305 A.D.) the province was subdivided into smaller administrative units: Hellespontus, Asia, Lydia, Caria, Phrygia I and Phrygia II. Due to its excellent harbors on the west coast and its many navigable rivers, Asia’s water-borne trade with the rest of the Mediterranean flourished. In the second century A.D. Asia experienced great prosperity, to which the growth and architectural aggrandizement of many of its cities attest. In the area of Kibyra, bordering the regions of Lycia, Caria, Phrygia and Pisidia, numerous inscriptions refer to the large imperial estates of Roman families. Woolen textiles, marble, and timber constituted a significant part of the commodities exported from the province.
While the Romans might have looked to the Greeks for inspiration in philosophy, architecture, sculpture, and the fine arts, the non-Greek peoples of the eastern Mediterranean are their inspiration for luxury, fine-living, and the status conferred by displays of individual wealth (Athenaeus Deip. XV.690). Asia was a center for such splendor, first in the kingdoms of Lydia, Phrygia, and Lycia, and then continued by the Persian satraps, and later the Hellenistic kings. The Persian paradeisos is particularly well-attested in literature referencing Asia. That these gardens are known primarily from Roman-period literary sources indicates their continuing influence. For example, long after the gold of Lydia’s Pactolus River had disappeared, Lydia remained a literary topos, not only for copious wealth, but for a life of luxury set in a landscape of natural abundance. Athenaeus (Deipnosophistae 12.515d-f) wrote in the second century A.D. that
&amp;ldquo;The Lydians in their luxury planned parks and made them like gardens and so kept in the shade. For they thought it more dainty not to have the sun’s rays touch them at all…&amp;rdquo;
Other districts of Asia captured the Roman imagination: Pliny the Elder writes of an ancient plane tree (Sycamorus orientalis) in Lycia with a girth of sufficient circumference to house a grotto in its hollow trunk, ornamented with pumice and moss with provisions for 18 people to dine there (Pliny HN 12.9).
The paradeisoi of the Persian satraps are of particular influence on the introduction of horti and gardens of Rome. The paradeisos, from the Persian, paira daeza, or “enclosed place,” is a term that had evolved by the Hellenistic period to mean a large enclosed park with luxurious gardens as well as orchards, collections of trees, crops, and hunting areas (see Sardis below). It was at Sardis that the Greek Lysander visited Cyrus the Younger, a visit recorded by Clearchus and retold by Xenophon. It is an essential moment in garden history recounted for the Romans by Cicero, De Senectute. 17.59. These paradeisoi, in the sense of luxurious orchards, are said by the Romans to have been brought to Greece by Kimon (Aristot. apud Plut. Cim. 10; comp. Cic. de Off. 2.18Plutarch), and were adopted by Hellenistic kings throughout Greece and southern Italy during the late Hellenistic period. The hunting parks at Daskyleion and Celenae are also vividly described by Xenophon (See Anabasis 1.2.7, 2.4.14 and Oeconomicus 4.13). Xenophon also describes how paradeisoi were occupied or cut down by armies during the fourth and third centuries BC. Appreciation for these parks apparently continued, and Seleucus of Syria took over the royal paradeisos at Sardis (Plutarch, Demetrios 50.6). Years of instability followed, so it is difficult to know what the Romans themselves thought of paradeisoi in Asia in the second and first centuries B.C. Notable examples of paradeisoi, in some form, may have been visible to Romans visiting Asia, as well. For example, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus is now thought by its excavators to have been set in a grove or park.
Thus, the paradeisos, the alsos, the gymnasium, and the quadriporticus are not forms the Romans suddenly “discovered.” They had had a long influence and were integrated into the Hellenistic architectural forms of the Italic landscape. In the second century B.C., however, when the Roman generals began to define themselves as rulers of an empire, they turned directly to the palaces and paradeisoi of the Hellenistic monarchs to establish their power, to display spoils of war, and to create the luxurious setting for life in Rome. They further adapted the evolving quadriporticus form for display to the public Despite the importance of Asia Minor in the history of the Roman landscape, archaeological evidence is scant. The excavators contacted for this essay indicated that parks, gardens, and other planted areas have yet to become a subject of research design for the region and finds appear to be few—primarily inscriptions and wall paintings. Most of the smaller domestic courtyards—often the most manageable to investigate - are paved. The larger palaestrae, gymnasia, and enclosed open spaces have not been investigated for landscape architectural and planting features, although recently an important campaign of work in the South Agora at Aphrodisias is setting an important precedent (see below). This catalog includes areas with dirt and incomplete paved surfaces, and notes sites where the excavators have some level of optimism about fruitful future study. The subject of designed landscapes, gardens, and planted areas in Asia Minor awaits archaeological investigation.

Garden Tomb Garden(?) of an Anonymous
Keywords  inscription heroon tomb grave  Garden Description A highly fragmentary inscription found in the south part of the Cayster River valley records the dedication of a piece of landed property apparently attached to a heroon. The tomb is not explicitly mentioned with the property in the surviving text (kayi°[rvsen d¢ k¢ kt∞ma ?t]Ú prosÚn t“ [≤r–ƒ]) but is implied in the reference elsewhere in the inscription to a banquet served at the monument (eÈvx¤[an e‰nai &amp;mdash;]da §p‹ toË mnh[me¤ou]). The combination of the two suggests the standard configuration of tomb with productive property attached—whether a field or a garden is impossible to say— to provide revenue for commemorative funerary celebrations at the grave.

      <description>Province Asia Asia (Pleiades)
Province description The region of what is now modern Turkey became a part of the Roman Empire in 133 B.C. when king Attalos III of Pergamum bequeathed his kingdom to the Roman people. The province included the heartland of the Pergamene kingdom as well as the territories of Mysia, Lydia, Ionia, Caria, western Phrygia and the eastern Aegean islands. Under Augustus in 27 B.C. Asia was declared a senatorial province and the governance of a proconsul. The capital of the province was Ephesos, although Pergamon may have fulfilled this role initially. Under Diocletian (284-305 A.D.) the province was subdivided into smaller administrative units: Hellespontus, Asia, Lydia, Caria, Phrygia I and Phrygia II. Due to its excellent harbors on the west coast and its many navigable rivers, Asia’s water-borne trade with the rest of the Mediterranean flourished. In the second century A.D. Asia experienced great prosperity, to which the growth and architectural aggrandizement of many of its cities attest. In the area of Kibyra, bordering the regions of Lycia, Caria, Phrygia and Pisidia, numerous inscriptions refer to the large imperial estates of Roman families. Woolen textiles, marble, and timber constituted a significant part of the commodities exported from the province.
While the Romans might have looked to the Greeks for inspiration in philosophy, architecture, sculpture, and the fine arts, the non-Greek peoples of the eastern Mediterranean are their inspiration for luxury, fine-living, and the status conferred by displays of individual wealth (Athenaeus Deip. XV.690). Asia was a center for such splendor, first in the kingdoms of Lydia, Phrygia, and Lycia, and then continued by the Persian satraps, and later the Hellenistic kings. The Persian paradeisos is particularly well-attested in literature referencing Asia. That these gardens are known primarily from Roman-period literary sources indicates their continuing influence. For example, long after the gold of Lydia’s Pactolus River had disappeared, Lydia remained a literary topos, not only for copious wealth, but for a life of luxury set in a landscape of natural abundance. Athenaeus (Deipnosophistae 12.515d-f) wrote in the second century A.D. that
&amp;ldquo;The Lydians in their luxury planned parks and made them like gardens and so kept in the shade. For they thought it more dainty not to have the sun’s rays touch them at all…&amp;rdquo;
Other districts of Asia captured the Roman imagination: Pliny the Elder writes of an ancient plane tree (Sycamorus orientalis) in Lycia with a girth of sufficient circumference to house a grotto in its hollow trunk, ornamented with pumice and moss with provisions for 18 people to dine there (Pliny HN 12.9).
The paradeisoi of the Persian satraps are of particular influence on the introduction of horti and gardens of Rome. The paradeisos, from the Persian, paira daeza, or “enclosed place,” is a term that had evolved by the Hellenistic period to mean a large enclosed park with luxurious gardens as well as orchards, collections of trees, crops, and hunting areas (see Sardis below). It was at Sardis that the Greek Lysander visited Cyrus the Younger, a visit recorded by Clearchus and retold by Xenophon. It is an essential moment in garden history recounted for the Romans by Cicero, De Senectute. 17.59. These paradeisoi, in the sense of luxurious orchards, are said by the Romans to have been brought to Greece by Kimon (Aristot. apud Plut. Cim. 10; comp. Cic. de Off. 2.18Plutarch), and were adopted by Hellenistic kings throughout Greece and southern Italy during the late Hellenistic period. The hunting parks at Daskyleion and Celenae are also vividly described by Xenophon (See Anabasis 1.2.7, 2.4.14 and Oeconomicus 4.13). Xenophon also describes how paradeisoi were occupied or cut down by armies during the fourth and third centuries BC. Appreciation for these parks apparently continued, and Seleucus of Syria took over the royal paradeisos at Sardis (Plutarch, Demetrios 50.6). Years of instability followed, so it is difficult to know what the Romans themselves thought of paradeisoi in Asia in the second and first centuries B.C. Notable examples of paradeisoi, in some form, may have been visible to Romans visiting Asia, as well. For example, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus is now thought by its excavators to have been set in a grove or park.
Thus, the paradeisos, the alsos, the gymnasium, and the quadriporticus are not forms the Romans suddenly “discovered.” They had had a long influence and were integrated into the Hellenistic architectural forms of the Italic landscape. In the second century B.C., however, when the Roman generals began to define themselves as rulers of an empire, they turned directly to the palaces and paradeisoi of the Hellenistic monarchs to establish their power, to display spoils of war, and to create the luxurious setting for life in Rome. They further adapted the evolving quadriporticus form for display to the public Despite the importance of Asia Minor in the history of the Roman landscape, archaeological evidence is scant. The excavators contacted for this essay indicated that parks, gardens, and other planted areas have yet to become a subject of research design for the region and finds appear to be few—primarily inscriptions and wall paintings. Most of the smaller domestic courtyards—often the most manageable to investigate - are paved. The larger palaestrae, gymnasia, and enclosed open spaces have not been investigated for landscape architectural and planting features, although recently an important campaign of work in the South Agora at Aphrodisias is setting an important precedent (see below). This catalog includes areas with dirt and incomplete paved surfaces, and notes sites where the excavators have some level of optimism about fruitful future study. The subject of designed landscapes, gardens, and planted areas in Asia Minor awaits archaeological investigation.
Location  Cayster River Valley (Pleiades)  Sublocation  Thyaira (Pleiades)  Garden Tomb Garden (peribolion) of an Anonymous
Keywords  inscription crematory periboloi ustrina tomb monument  Garden Description A broken inscription found near Thyaira in 1901 records the second part of a funerary dedication in which the dedicant prescribes who can be buried in his monument and forbids anyone “to sell this tomb or the garden (peribÒlion) in front of it with the crematory in it oÈk §j°stai d¢ oÈden[‹] pvl∞sai toËto tÚ ≤r“on oÈd¢ tÚ prÚ aÈtoË peribÒlion §n ⁄ §stin ≤kaÊstra)”. The prohibition against alienation suggests that peribÒlion here, like peribÒlow at Attaleia and Hypaipa in Lydia and often elsewhere, refers metonymically to a garden enclosed within the wall rather than simply to the wall itself. The crematory (≤kaÊstra)—a feature seldom mentioned in funerary inscriptions in Asia Minor—suggests a Roman style tomb garden, with ustrina	and tomb monument enclosed within the same perimeter wall, as often around Rome and on the Bay of Naples.

Keywords  statue peribolo tomb  Garden Description A statue base found in 1886 in a modern cemetery midway along the path between Gueuktché-Ahmed and Seldjikli preserves, on its front, a decree of the local senate and people at Attaleia passed, probably, some time during the second century honoring Bassus and his father Euarestos for their demonstration of piety toward the guardian Zeus of the city; on its right side, an excerpt from Euarestos’s will instructing his heir to provide oil to the community on one day a year annually; and, on its left side, detailed instructions for the implementation of the foundation: “From the first to the fifth hour of the day the oil shall be provided from the revenues of the garden (per™€bolow) purchased from Eubolos, the son of Antiphanes, for Bassos, son of Euarestos, grandson of Phocas”.

The location of the garden in relation to Bassos’s tomb is not specified, and the statue base recording its purchase and the honorific decree recognizing it were probably set up in a public place rather than at the tomb, but the commemorative purpose of the garden in supporting an annual distribution in his name is clear, and it is likely that the two properties were near each other, if not contiguous. In accordance with an idiomatic usage common in both Greek and Latin and favored in Lydia (as at Hypaipa and Thyaira), the garden is identified metonymically by reference to its enclosure wall (per™€bolow), the sine qua non of a tomb garden in the Greco-Roman world.

Keywords  Nymphs temenos strategos palm-grove agora  Garden Description An inscription (MAMA VIII, 448) indicates that Artemidorus Pedias, during his term as strategos, promised to “adorn a palm grove with a statue of Hermes, and a gilded Aphrodite with Erotes holding lamps on either side and a marble Eros in Front” (Roueché, 70.) The location of this garden is not specified. Robert suggests, based on the location of the inscription, that it was in the temenos of Aphrodite (Robert, 257). Roueché conjectures that it perhaps lay on the east side of the agora, based upon the presence of Hermes Agoraios (MAMA VIII, 406, 445, 446, and CIG 2770). She proposes that the grove was later embellished by the fountain at the agora gate, where inscriptions (Hell. IV, 131-2) honor the conversion of the gate into a fountain, alluding to the Nymphs of the “place of the palms” (RRR Smith et al. 2018) Roueché notes that this palm-grove, with its walks, statuary, and fountains was clearly an elaborately decorated park. The agora and temenos have been identified. The south agora (215 x 70m) features a long, monumental basin in its center.

Alameda (Pleiades)
Location Description Ruins of large Roman baths, now surrounded by an interpretive center, and numerous finds of Roman coins and pottery fragments make clear that there was a considerable Roman town here with its center in the heart of the modern town. Its name, however, has not been determined for certain. The villa described below is near the modern town cemetery. It seems, however, that the villa was reburied for its protection.
Garden Villa del Cortijo de los Vila
Keywords  fountains mosaics (visual works) peristyles (columnades) statuettes (free-standing sculpture)  Garden Description Excavations in 1985 and 1986 brought to light a villa dating to the end of the third or beginning of the fourth century AD. The villa is also known as the “Finca del Moral.” Measures were taken to preserve the fine mosaics. In the peristyle of the villa there was a rectangular garden area [A] with rounded corners and semicircles on the four sides. At its center is a square brick structure faced with marble, which was probably a fountain. Also found in the villa was a statuette of Priapus, who was often associated with gardens, and whose cult images often appeared in them. The figure, placed in the center of the garden and dating from the end of the second century, is adorned with bunches of grapes, surrounded by flowers, birds and a pair of sandals.

In this room was a grand composition depicting a procession of people. Next to this room was a square room that looked out down the long axis of the garden that filled the 247 square meter rectangular (19 x 13 m) rectangle of open area. The Corinthian colonnade of the garden was found collapsed towards the outside. Elegant Corinthian capitals of limestone and fragments of column bases of attic type with traces of tinted whitewash and red accents were found during the excavations.

Garden House with Pilasters (Clos du Verbe Incarné)
Keywords  insula / insulae atrium Domus  Garden Description The insula VII of the Clos du Verbe Incarné, excavated from 1977 to 1987, lies on the western slope of a little dip (71 x 34 m) in the upper town, about 160 meters northwest of the center of the top of the theater. In this insula, begun between 40 and 20 BC, one can follow the evolution of this quarter up to the end of the third century. To the north, the insula was bordered by the street called du Capitol and to the west by the street called de Cybèle. The subdivision of the insula was put in place from 15–10 BC. The house occupied 400 square meters, and was organized on an italic plan around a traditional atrium followed by a tablinum[1]. The house of seven or eight rooms did not have a peristyle but did, no doubt, include a hortus[2] (15 x 5 m) at the back of the lot.
The house was originally constructed of adobe on a floor and gutter of granite masonry. Later, in Tibero-Claudian times, a wooden section was added, which facilitated the creation of an upper story on the western part, which also included on the ground level some isolated shops occupying 100 square meters. The neighbor to the north was another small, 315-square-meter house, the Domus with the Mosaic Emblema, which was organized around a four-column atrium, but had no garden. In fact, the House with Pilasters was the only one in the insula to have, without doubt, a little green space. In the southern part of the insula, there were three combinations of house and shop, and another small, 310-square-meter house called the Domus with Lararium.

It was built around 100 A.D. and occupied until the 4th century.
On the southeast of the house was a vestibule, from which a central corridor departed at a 90 degree angle. This corridor divided the house into two parts of equal width. Two walls at right angles to the house at the northeast enclosed an area in which the excavators found &amp;ldquo;fine garden soil.&amp;rdquo; This observation allows the reconstruction of a garden, probably a kitchen garden, next to the house (G in Fig. 1).

Keywords  epitaphs inscription literary garden tombs  Garden Description A limestone slab found near the monastery of St. Martin in Szombathely (Savaria), Hungary, in 1845 and subsequently transferred to the National Museum in Budapest records the epitaph of a high ranking equestrian official (vir perfectissimus), Fl(avius) Dalmatius, and his wife Aur(elia) Iulia, who some time during the third or fourth century built a tomb on their villa estate and composed for it a verse inscription in which Dalmatius hopes for commemoration from a future owner of the property: “Whoever will be master of this house and garden after me, gather the nearby roses for me, put out the white lilies which the green garden will grow for me: these are the gifts of the blessed” (Quisquis {h}e(ris) post me d(o)m(inus) Laris huius et (h)orti, / vicinas mihi carpe rosas, mihi lilia pone / [ca]ndeda{s} q(uae) viridis dabit (h)ortulus: ista (sc. munera) beat(or)um). A freedman Volussius and freedwoman Sabatia saw to the erection of the inscription and monument. On the basis of the final platitude, with its reference to “the blessed” (beati), Diehl considered Dalmatius and his wife to be Christians. For Adamik, on the other hand, commemoration with flowers, a practice condemned by Christian writers as idolatrous, points to a pagan context. The phrasing of the hexameters reveals familiarity also with Roman literary conventions of funerary commemoration (cf. Martial 1.61.3, quiquis eris nostri post me regnator agelli&amp;hellip;).Whatever the religious beliefs of Dalmatius and his wife, the equipping of their tomb with a funerary garden to support commemorative celebrations at the site is fully in keeping with the literary pretensions of their epitaph in representing the couple as fully assimilated and sophisticated Romans.

After passing through a room interpreted as the atrium, one arrived in the open courtyard which had a peristyle on three sides (G on plan). On the northern edge of the courtyard was a podium (P on plan) near which votive altars to Diana and Silvanus were found, both gods of the woods and suitable subjects for a garden. This corner of the courtyard, thus, seems to have had religious character. In the middle of the courtyard was a square foundation, measuring 1.80 x 1.80 m., possibly the remains of a base for some kind of figure. The villa rustica was established in the early 2nd century and occupied probably until the 4th century.

One of these houses (B on plan) on a street corner in Carnuntum exhibits this plan clearly (Fig. 1). South of the house, facing the street and separate from it, are various rooms which were interpreted as shops and workshops. North of the house is an open unpaved courtyard which is usually assumed to have been a garden, perhaps a kitchen garden (G on plan). The neighboring house (A in Fig. 1) to the east is of similar plan, if somewhat more irregular, and it too has an open courtyard at the north (G on plan).

Keywords  archaeological garden bathhouses (water recreation structures) fountains peristyles (Roman courtyards) piscinae statues statuettes (free-standing sculpture)  Garden Description Very few houses of Mediterranean type have been discovered, and only one can be said with certainty to have had a garden (Fig. 1, G in Fig. 1). The peristyle courtyard was a prominent feature of this house of irregular plan and substantial size near the southern city wall. The house dates to the 3rd century, and it is thought to have been a clubhouse or schola for young men (collegium iuventutis), complete with a bath suite. In the middle of the courtyard, framed on four sides by a low wall supporting columns, was a square masonry pool (Fig. 2). In the center of the pool was a fountain consisting of a small marble satyr standing on a column of the same material. This decorative element and the unpaved ground strongly suggest the existence of a garden.

      <description>Province Pannonia
Province Description The creation of the province of Pannonia can be dated to the years following 9 B.C., after the Pannonian tribes had been defeated by Tiberius. The province occupied the western half of modern Hungary up to the Danube in the north and east. Its western neighboring province was Noricum; to the south lay the Save river, Dalmatia, and the Adriatic coast. Because of its frontier position on the Danube, Pannonia was heavily garrisoned by the Roman army throughout its history. Probably to meet the needs of the army, large estates and villas were developed in the Pannonian plains, particularly around Lake Balaton (or Palso) and the Neusiedler (or Fertö) Lake. Large-scale vineyards were planted in the late Empire, producing wine probably for regional consumption. Grain and cattle, however, were not just consumed in Pannonia, but also exported to northern Italy in the late 3rd and 4th centuries. Under Trajan in 106/107 A.D., the province was separated into two parts: Pannonia Superior, with the governor’s residence in Carnuntum, and Pannonia Inferior with its capital in Aquincum. In the late 3rd and early 4th century under Diocletian and Constantine, the Pannonian provinces were split into four parts: Pannonia Prima, Savia, Pannonia Secunda and Valeria, with their capitals in Savaria, Siscia, Sopianae and Sirmium respectively.

The lateral walls of the complex could be followed over a length of 395 meters, but it is assumed that they once extended up to the lake southeast of the farm. The house, measuring 56.70 x 82.40 meters, was of the winged corridor type (Fig. 12.1). The villa rustica was built in the first half of the 1st century A.C. and inhabited until its destruction in 250. The two protruding wings on either side of the entrance on the north extended to the dividing wall between the pars urbana and the pars rustica. These may have been built as covered porticoes or pergolas. The large terraced courtyard between them was possibly laid out as a garden or park (G in Fig. 1). Immediately north of the dividing wall was a well-house.

Location Description The defensibility offered by this unique geography made Caesar hasten to occupy Vesontio in 58 BC. The town came to have all the usual Roman structures– forum, baths, aqueduct, and amphitheater (on the other side of the Doubs, to the northwest.) But the most visible remnant is the Porte Noire (Black Gate) [3], a triumphal arch built by Marcus Aurelius at the southeastern end of the cardo maximus, today Grande Rue and still the center of city life.
Archaeology in a downtown area is always a matter of seizing opportunities as they are presented by new construction, remembering and recording what was found, and coming back years later to complete the picture. A good example of this process is at our second site, [2] on the map. In 1973, the Neptune Mosaic was discovered in rue de Lorraine, one of the largest floor decorations in all Gaul. The extent of the mosaic under nearby buildings made full excavation impossible. More than thirty years later, in 2004, construction of a gymnasium for the Collège Lumière (a middle school) gave archaeologists access to much more of the site, about 3000 square meters, for a salvage excavation. As expected, the continuation of the Neptune mosaic was found; moreover, three other mosaics of high quality, along with columns, sculpted blocks, peristyles, and monumental pools came to light. The results of this excavation have not been published; we are grateful to the excavators for sharing their preliminary results.
Garden Structures under the Collège Lumière in Vesontio
Keywords  colonnades kraters mosaics (visual works) opus signinum peristyles (Roman courtyards) piscinae porticoes reception rooms rinceaux terrazzo  Garden Description The results of the 2004 excavation at the Collège Lumière are still under study and the data are therefore still partial. This zone, close to the river and the artisinal quarter has, in the past, yielded most of the mosaics recorded for Besançon. The ancient structures discovered on 3000 square meters relate to a Gallo-Roman urbanization extending from the Augustan period to the third century and superimposed on a rather dense Gallic occupation of the first century BC. Two phases of construction from the late Augustan period up through the end of the first century, have thus far not permitted the confirmation of the possible presence of a garden. On the other, later constructions dating from the beginning and last third of the second century are rich in peristyles with open space suitable for a garden.
At the beginning of the second century, in a third phase, a structure of large dimension (at least 2500 m2) but undetermined purpose was built on fill and leveling of the abandoned earlier buildings. It will simplify descriptions to let “north” denote the direction that is actually northeast, the direction towards the river. In these terms, large rooms (the largest reaching 126 sq. m.) and corridors were bordered on the south by an open area, possibly a garden, with porticos on at least the north and west sides, and by one peristyle to the west and by another to the east. The walls of the porticos around these peristyles were decorated with painted plaster. The west peristyle (at least 22 x 20 m) is the most complete. Only one wall, the east wall of the west peristyle, is common to these second century structures and the preceding ones of first century. It may thus represent a property line. Originally, it opened over a large threshold between the largest of the rooms and the western peristyle. It was subsequently first reduced and then completely closed.
The fourth phase, a remodeling at the end of the second century, is the best preserved, but its purpose remains unclear. It has yielded a series of elements that allow us to follow the architectural reasoning of the builders. It kept the basic plan of the third state: a peristyle to the east, one to the west, and a large garden to the south. The rooms, however, are considerably rearranged. Three grand reception rooms (of 200, 85, and 65 m2 ) with floors decorated with luxurious mosaics are organized in a very regular fashion in relation to the two peristyles and garden by corridors or galleries. The floors of these numerous spaces of circulation were a terrazzo in an opus signinum matrix, except for the gallery of garden, which had a mosaic.
The largest of the rooms, decorated by the Neptune mosaic, opened on its north side through a colonnade onto the south of the east peristyle and through another colonnade on the opposite side to the garden on the south. The spacing of the columns was the same (4.6 m) on both colonnades. The excavated part of the east peristyle showed that it was 22.3 meters wide; if it was square, it would have had an area of about 500 square meters. Another large room decorated with the rinceaux mosaic (so called for the bands of scrolled foliage) also opens onto the east peristyle. The gallery that borders the garden was widened into the garden in front of the Neptune room; against the wall of this extension there was a pool at least 1.5 meters wide and probably about 13 meters long. Several paving stones of the bottom have survived. The last room, the one with the Medusa mosaic, would seem to have opened onto the garden. The garden was about .95 meters lower than the house and was reached by descending four steps. The north portico of the west peristyle was enlarged in this final phase; the interval between columns reached 6.7 meters. The presence of the closed wall that may have been a property line obliges us to ask Did this west peristyle really belong to the structure to the east or was it part of a different edifice that may have extended to the west outside the limits of the excavation?
A fragment of a little ornamental stone krater was found in the material that filled the east peristyle after its abandonment. From late antiquity is the foundation of a pool or cistern of about 3.5 by 2.5 meters. Its stones have been removed, and only the opus signinum mortar bearing the imprint of the stones has been found. This structure pierced through all the archaeological levels and into the natural earth.

 domus fountains hypocausts mosaics (visual works) opus sectile (visual works) opus signinum oeci peristyles (columnades) piscinae porticoes terrazzo water wells  Garden Description In 2000-2001, at the time of construction a new judiciary facility, an area of 2000 square meters was excavated at the center of this loop. The results are in large part unpublished. On land that had been occupied since the end of the second century BC, two houses of perishable materials were built in the eastern part of the site in the beginning of the first century AD. They were abandoned at the beginning of the Flavian epoch, and replaced by two imposing domus that lasted up to the middle of the third century. They stood on opposite sides of a property line wall (tinted in purple in Fig. 1) that was parallel to a cardo running in a northwest-to-southeast direction some hundred meters away. The two houses had slightly different orientations. The eastern house doubtless opened onto a southwest-northeast street passing 50 meters beyond the eastern limit of the excavation but partially brought to light in 1989-90 during excavations when a new parking facility was being built for the city hall. In this house, two independent structures (oecus) (tinted pink in the figure) with floors once decorated with mosaics since disappeared are wrapped about and connected by a portico (yellow tint) of complex plan with galleries 3 meters wide and opening onto an open space (green tint) covering 110 square meters. The counterpart of this portico is in part visible on the other side of the larger room. An incompletely known peristyle borders this oecus to the east (on the lower right edge of the plan). Its gallery was decorated with a terrazzo floor of opus signinum with accents of crustae, thin stone slices of which an opus sectile is made. In this phase, the north domus had a peristyle of 75 square meters with galleries on three sides. To the west (lower left corner of the plan), there was a large open space of nearly 500 square meters, which may have been a garden. At its west end, the wall of an incomplete building ran by a well and a masonry square 2.16 meters on a side which may have been the base of a shrine or monument. These structures were aligned with the property line wall. There was as yet no pool.
In the second half of the second century, the “garden” was restructured. The building on the west side was abandoned, the shrine or monument was kept, and a large pool put in at the eastern end supported against the wall of a terrace supporting the house to the east and consequently having the same orientation. This rectangular pool (21.2 x 3.5 m) had on the garden side a semicircular apse 6.9 meters in diameter. As part of the same architectural ensemble, a portico formed the retro-scene of the pool. Its opus signinum floor was 80 centimeters above the surface of the pool. Another, wider portico ran along the north side of the area. A shim-shaped gap existed between it and the property-line wall because of the difference in orientation. The monumental character of the pool and the north portico suggests that this garden may have been independent of both houses and was possibly a public space or belonged to a house further west, outside the limits of excavation.
At the beginning of the third century, the two domus were transformed. In particular, polychrome mosaics were installed in the east house and rooms with hypocausts in the north house. The little shrine or monument at the western end of the garden was eliminated, but the pool was reconstructed without alteration. The paving stones that had been in a pool were in part removed and used to build a 3.8 x 2.9 meter platform which served as the base, presumably, of a quadrangular fountain in the north house in an open space which replaced the peristyle, which was then destroyed.

Keywords  arbors barns cisterns (plumbing components) ceramic tile ditches fences (site elements) hearths horrea kitchen gardens mosaics (visual works) orchards pedestals pillars piscinae porticoes sherds tesserae villae rusticae water supply systems  Garden Description Located 6km south-east of Avenches/ Aventicum, the capital of the Helvetian tribe, this site is situated on a small alluvial terrace at the bottom of a hillside. The area is bordered by a stream, the Laret, characterized by a flow, sometimes torrential, that has fluctuated during the past centuries. To the west, on the right bank, stands the rocky spur of Carignan (Fig. 1). Due to the relatively restrictive topography, human settlements favoured the left bank until the Middle Ages.
On the spur east of the stream, a building made of a light structure, apparently isolated, is constructed at the beginning of the 1st c. CE; it is bordered on its southern and northern sides by two roads. During the years 30/40 CE, a peripheral gallery on wooden pillars is placed around it. Its layout rather suggests an annex of a villa rustica or perhaps even a simple house in an urban context. Between 50 and 70 CE, it is surrounded by two other constructions, which together with the first building take on the characteristic shape of an “L”. The northern house is made of several habitation rooms; as it is bordered by a portico, it recalls the dwelling places of the medium-sized villae rusticae discovered in Switzerland. The southern building, surrounded by galleries, is laid out around a 100 m2 large kitchen, containing a large central hearth, which separates, to the south, the rooms designed for habitation, and the areas, to the north, apparently dedicated to utilitarian activities. At the back of the southern construction, a fourth building was erected, a barn (horreum) recognizable because of the network of pillars that supported an elevated floor.
A wall section, placed under a later separating wall, already indicates the existence of a division of the area between the northern and southern parts of the garden. The occupation layer is marked by a number of undated hollow structures. A ditch, boarded on the east by two big oval pits, distinguishes itself by its orientation which is parallel to the front of the central building, but its function still remains unknown: could it be an early garden arrangement? The only palynological analysis undertaken in a trench opened in the north building, suggest a tree canopy composed of a mixture of oaks, birches and hazel trees, in the second half of the 1st century CE; alders and willow trees could be found along the stream banks. An abundance of ferns and conifers grew in the surrounding areas. Herbaceous vegetation was intermingled with cereals. The information in our possession is too scarce to allow us to interpret it as a garden. Traces of equidistant posts or peg holes appear to form the outline of structures that are still difficult to explain (light arbour-like construction?). This open space is confined by a small bank to the south. Below it, the area is crossed by two long perpendicular depressions that could have a natural origin (paleochannel?), re-used as rubbish disposals at the beginning of our era. The south-east oriented channel, originally interpreted as a clay extraction pit, was cleared over a distance of approximately thirty meters. It was seven to eight meters wide, 1,2 meters deep and contained, in its lower part, several conduits made from pine trees (fig. 3). These timber elements were not assembled but stored in a humid environment before being used. The preparation and preservation of wood for plumbing systems, suggests the existence, from the first Antique settlements, of a very elaborate running water supply system, its use in domestic and/or handicraft or farming activities still needs to be clarified. Dendrochronology reveals two time series, dated to the autumn/winter 3/4 CE and 32/33 CE. These dates, that are contemporary with the first building stages of the villa, are very early for Switzerland and are close to Avenche’s first dated constructions.
The edges of the channel, which are gradually filled in, are bordered by two small fences in the last quarter of the Ist century; these fittings may be the result of a wish to stabilize the banks of the channel, clearly still under water at that time. Later on, the channel is filled in by a new rubbish disposal that seals the fences. We know nothing about the appearance of the area (courtyard or garden?) which extended between the channel and the southern building.
The profound architectural developments that took place in the three habitation buildings from the years 150/160 CE, had repercussions on the gardens (fig. 2). The occupation layer of the courtyards to the west of the buildings is raised by bringing in a large amount of ballast material. The subdivision of the garden zone is not precisely known. To the west of the constructed area, in the northern area bordered by the waterway, a pedestal indicates the presence of a statuary decoration that will be removed by the next generation. A long masonry wall, decorated with pillars presumably sculpted, is the only partition element brought to light. It marks the boundaries of an area interpreted as an ornamental garden, onto which the northern building and the northern part of the central building open. Divided into two zones, the oriental part of the northern garden is covered with tiles, revealing in its northern corner a fountain; it is replaced, in its western part, by soil around which a fence was probably built. It communicates directly with a second ornamental garden situated on the side of the central building, maybe destined for the private use of the family and close relatives. Here too, the remains are sparse: a patch stretches along the separation wall with the northern garden. A path followed the central building. Others must have crossed beds of plants edged with vertical ceramic elements. In other places, wooden posts formed rows that are still difficult to elucidate but that may indicate the outline of arbours. In the same place were found meander shaped ditches which do not follow the exact same orientation as the buildings (fig. 4). Were they hedges that were part of a vegetal maze? Despite the absence of palynological facts, they can be compared to the ditches excavated in the gardens of the Fishbourne Villa (England) or to those in the pars urbana of Dietikon’s villae (canton of Zurich).
At the end of the first archaeological excavations (1985-2000), we favoured the hypothesis of a subdivision of the area to the west of the buildings into three juxtaposed courtyards which echoed the tripartition of the constructions. They contained two ornamental gardens, in the north and in the center, and a courtyard that sheltered a kitchen garden and an orchard at the front of the southern building, dedicated to utilitarian activities (fig. 5). The recent research does not support a division of the area into three distinctive courtyards (2006/2010). The second garden, which presents a regular incline to the south, does not show any tangible boundary. Did it occupy the whole area in the front of the south building, or were they garden arrangements (hedges) dividing it? (fig. 6) Traces of vegetation being very hard to spot on the surface of the ground of the gardens, no definitive conclusion can be drawn.
The recent discovery of the lower part of a pool in front of the south building has also casts doubts on its utilitarian function. The structure itself, laid on a foundation of stakes made from oak and alder wood dated by dendrochonology to the years after 160 CE, has been almost entirely retrieved. The interpretation of this structure is still under discussion: it could be a cistern but it is more likely to be an ornamental pool that could have been enhanced by a parietal mosaic composed of the many glass tesserae that were found nearby. The structure, standing against the south building, would be oriented not towards the construction itself, but towards the courtyard where no garden arrangement has been uncovered.
Whereas the courtyards have offered very few traces for the Early Roman Period, the Late Antique Period marks a turning point in the history of Vallon’s gardens. Following a fire, the buildings are reorganized and areas dedicated to handicraft activities appear in the porticoes. A new function is attributed to the courtyards. The rubble of the partially demolished north and central buildings is discarded in the northern garden and the northern part of the second courtyard. To the south of themeander shaped ditches, is built a construction consisting of posts and sill plates, equipped with a ground hearth made out of ceramic tiles. The late occupation of the gardens seems to be linked to the salvage and transformation of building materials collected in the edifices. Other post structures (constructions? enclosures?) almost cover the whole area in the front of the southern building. The archaeological objects found (pottery fragments, over a hundred coins) suggest that this occupation partly covers the IVth century and does not go further than the beginning of the Vth century.
After the disappearance of the Antique site, the land continues to be occupied during the Early Middle Ages. The discovery of channels supports the hypothesis that the areas between the new buildings or on their sides, were well enough built to see the creation of an ornamental garden. However, the remains are too disrupted to allow further discussion.

 corridors terrace gardens villae rusticae  Garden Description This large palatial house belonged to a villa rustica revealed by excavation and aerial photography. The enclosed farmyard is calculated to have been approximately 420 x 650 meters in size. The house itself, built in the mid-1st century AD and in use until the 4th century, was 200 meters long (Fig. 1). This winged corridor house had two large open courtyards between the protruding wings at the front. These were very likely gardens (G in Fig. 1). Twenty-five meters in front of the house at the east was a long terrace wall 400 meters long running north-south. There may have been gardens or a park (G in Fig. 1) between the house and this terrace wall.

The main residence and bath complex (A and B in Fig. 1), dating to the beginning of the 2nd century, stood on sloping land eight meters higher than the rest of the farmyard. At the eastern end of the service area (pars rustica) was a large peristyle building with a nymphaeum at the western end (D in Fig. 1). The open courtyard within this peristyle may have been a garden. Small kitchen gardens have been reconstructed between the various outbuildings and smaller houses (C in Fig. 1) in the pars rustica. Gardens here are possible, but it remains a matter of speculation whether these areas were actually planted.

Garden Tomb Garden of Ti. Claudios Lykos
Keywords  tombs sarcophagi epitaphs  Garden Description A limestone sarcophagus found at Thessaloniki and first reported in 1962 preserves an epitaph set up in 147 A.D. by Ti. Claudios Lykos, a local town counselor (bouleutÆw), for himself, his loving wife Meinoukia (Minucia) Theoprepes, and his two daughters Roda and Theoprepes. As Robert correctly observed (Bull. Épigr. 1963:134), the garbled inscription—a product, it seems, of two drafts of the text being confused by the carver—nonetheless makes clear that Lykos had built a tomb garden complex, which he calls a ≤r“on, comprising “a field, house, garden, and, burial place” (égrÒw, oﬁk€a, k∞pow, tÒpow), in which were situated various sarcophagi (lhnÒi) and statues (éndriãntew) and which he attempted to prevent from future alienation. Two other inscriptions found in the same complex identify Lykos as granting, in one case, a cinerary urn (kaÊstra), in the other, in 167 A.D., a burial place (tÒpow) to others for their monuments. A secondary inscription on the cover of Lykos’s sarcophagus attests its reuse later in the third century. Robert and Kubińska considered the “house” (oﬁk€a) to be that of a gardener appointed to oversee the garden complex, but the traditional formulaic pairing of field and house, garden and tomb attested elsewhere (at the tomb gardens of C. Hostius Pamphilus at Rome [cross-ref, XXX] and of C. [Ma?]rcius C. l. Cleon at Bari [cross-ref XXX]) suggests that it is Lykos’s own house that is meant and, perhaps, that the tomb garden is located on its property. For the conventional “tomb” (tãfow, sepulchrum, monumentum) Lykos substitutes “burial place” (tÒpow, Latin locus, as in l(ocus) d(atus) d(ecreto) d(ecurionum), a formula for awarding honorific burials with which Lykos the decurion was assuredly familiar), but his conformity to the traditional conceptual juxtapositions is apparent. To judge from the presence of statues and more than one sarcophagus, and from the granting of burial space to others, Lykos’s funerary garden was a substantial complex.

The enclosed area of the farm occupied an area of 3.4 hectares (180 x 190 meters), and it was divided into a residential part (pars urbana) and a service area (pars rustica) by a road running east-west (Fig. 1). The front of the house (H in Fig. 1) faced north and had a view of the valley and the lower lying service area of the farm.
Built in the early 2nd century, the house was of the winged corridor type with a large open courtyard enclosed by the protruding wings of the house. The courtyard was divided into two zones that were possibly gardens (G in Fig. 1) and have been reconstructed as such. The farm was destroyed by fire in the first half of the 3rd century.

Keywords  archaeological garden axial plan corridors pergolas piscinae porticoes villae rusticae  Garden Description This villa rustica complex was built on a site at the bottom of a valley near and parallel to the river Limmat. Dietikon was situated on an important land and water traffic route from the Bündner Alps to Vindonissa and further north to the Rhine. Recent excavations supply valuable evidence for a garden in front of the entrance to a rural residence, giving insight into the appearance of other similar villas at which, for one reason or another, no physical remains of gardens have been retrieved. The excavations revealed a first villa with timber buildings dating to the Tiberian period, or early 1st century AD. Around the middle of the 1st century AD these first buildings were replaced by an axially-constructed stone-built villa complex with an enclosure, covering a total surface of 13 hectares (Fig. 1 and 4).
In the residential part of the farm (pars urbana) was a large corridor villa with two protruding wings enclosing a courtyard area on three sides. This area was planted as an ornamental garden in the mid-1st century (Fig 2, G in Fig. 2). On either side of the central path, garden zones were bordered by bedding trenches, 20-25 centimeters deep and 20-40 centimeters wide. The line of plantings flanking the path are curved to form two niches (Fig. 3). In Dietikon, digging of planting trenches would have been necessary because the massive layers of construction debris deposited to level this area for the building would have hampered a successful growing of garden plants. The archaeobotanical analysis of several soil samples revealed little of relevance, but box hedges have been suggested as the vegetation in the bedding trenches, forming a low living edge to these formal garden beds, and possibly climbing plants such as ivy along the porticoed façade. Shallow pits in the plots surrounded by the hedges may be the remains of bedding pits for trees or shrubs. A timber pergola in the courtyard ran parallel to the northeast wing of the house. To the west of the courtyard garden was a timber-lined pool fed by a stream, interpreted as a fishpond. Bedding trenches for hedges surrounded it.
In the late 1st century, around AD 70, the timber-lined pool in the west was replaced by a masonry pool lined with water-proof plaster on the same spot (Fig. 5). This was possibly fed by water from a small stream. At the same time, the timber pergola was dismantled, its place taken by a large masonry pool, 3 x 22 meters in plan. The planting pattern of the courtyard garden was retained (Fig. 5) until after the middle of the 2nd century when the pools were destroyed and the garden leveled.

The estate was built in the second half of the 2nd century and occupied until its destruction around 275.
The three-storied villa with more than 50 rooms on the ground floor alone, many decorated with mosaics and imported marble revetment, was centered on a colonnaded garden courtyard (G in Fig. 1). Many of the sandstone columns from the peristyle, as well as fragments of sculpture from the garden, were found in the courtyard. The house was built into a hill, and the courtyard was terraced on two levels. Around the edges of the garden was a ground level gutter. From the apsed triclinium on the south, with a mosaic floor and a marble fountain in the middle, there was an excellent view of the garden.
At the northeast of the villa was a garden (G in Fig. 1) with a lararium. On the southwest there was a garden (G in Fig. 1) with a fountain. The northern facade had a cryptoporticus below and a porticoed corridor on the story above. The service area of the villa rustica lay in front of the villa to the north.

Keywords  tombs epitaphs sarcophagi (coffins)  Garden Description A sarcophagus found at Salona in 1824, transported to the museum in Split, and subsequently lost bore an inscription recording the donation by Aur(elius) Aprilianus to Aur(elius) Amurus and Aur(elia) Quinta of a sarcophagus “which is in the garden of Metrodorus” and specifying that it was put into position while they were still alive (Aur(elius) Aprilianus se vivo donavet arcam Aur(elio) Amuro et Aur(eliae) Quinte que est in orto Metrodori. Vivi sibi posuerunt…). The find spot of the sarcophagus is not known, but Wilkes plausibly associates the garden of Metrodorus with a walled cemetery a hundred meters outside the city gate on the north side of the road leading west from town, which comprises a number of individual familial plots marked out by dividing walls within an area enclosed by a massive masonry perimeter built of blocks more than four meters long. The garden of Metrodorus was perhaps home also to the monument of Iulia Mutiana erected “among the sarcophagi in the middle in the garden, near the road, overlooking the old (?) courtyard (or seed bed)” (see the preceding entry): the two inscriptions belong broadly to the same period (the latter second or third century) and might well be contemporary with each other.

The most remarkable feature of the building was a T-shaped garden courtyard (G in Fig. 1) surrounded by a peristyle on all sides (Fig. 1). A ground line gutter ran around the edge of the courtyard. In the southern part of the garden was a large pool paved with limestone slabs and measuring 6 x 12 meters On the northern edge of the pool was a rectangular fountain. To the north of this was a square structure measuring 5.40 x 5.40 meters which may have been a garden pavilion.

Keywords  tombs epitaphs  Garden Description An inscription reported among those of Salona records an epitaph set up by Iulia Mutiana for herself and her husband Aur(elius) Pateas in a place granted her by A. Aelius Marullinus “among the sarcophagi in the middle in the garden, near the road, overlooking the old (?) courtyard (or seed bed)” (inter arcas in medio in horto at viam prospicientem in areolam vet(erem ?)). The specification of a location within the garden, the mention of (other) sarcophagi, and the concession of Marullinus suggest that the cemetery was extensive and perhaps public. The term areola used to describe the area overlooked by Mutiana’s monument generally means “courtyard” in architectural contexts (e.g. CIL 6.9077), “garden plot” or “seed bed” in agricultural ones (e.g. Columella 5.12.3, 10.362, 11.2.75). It is difficult to know which sense is to be preferred here. Whatever its character, Mommsen questioned the description of the areola as “old” (vet(erem)) and proposed an alternative reading “behind” (ret(ro)), unnecessarily, it seems. Nomenclature and circumstance (inhumation burial) point to a date in the second half of the second or the third century.

Location Aventicum
Aventicum (Pleiades)
Location Description The town was established in the Augustan period as the civitas capital of the Helvetii. At this time the orthogonal street grid was laid out. Most probably in AD 71, it became Colonia Pia Flavia Constans Emerita Helvetiorum Foederata. The town was destroyed or badly damaged around AD 260, and it was progressively abandoned thereafter.
Garden Palatial House in Insula 7 in Aventicum
Keywords  archaeological garden axial plan bathhouses (water recreation structures) drains exedrae (site elements) mosaics (visual works) palaces peristyles (Roman courtyards) piscinae presence chambers  Garden Description The remains of a palatial house (Palais de Derrière la Tour) were recently uncovered in excavations on the western edge of the city in an area characterized by luxurious domestic dwellings (Fig. 1). The house in its final state, from the Severan period to the middle of the 3rd century, had a peristyle courtyard measuring 42 x 69 meters. North of the courtyard was a reception room 12 x 18 meters in plan with a mosaic floor.
The courtyard was on two levels, divided on the north by a terrace wall with two small exedrae, possibly pools. An axially arranged central pathway between the reception room on the north and an apsed triclinium on the south further divided the courtyard into an eastern and a western half. Steps led up to the triclinium and to the northern wing of the house. A ground level gutter ran around the courtyard, and a covered drain crossed it beneath the central path. It can reasonably be assumed that the courtyard was designed as a garden (G in Fig. 1) with garden elements such as the path and the exedral pools. With the addition on the northeast of another wing terminating in a bath complex, the building ultimately had a length of around 200 meters. The excavators believe that the building in its latest phase had official character.

Garden House in Insula 30 in Augusta Raurica
Keywords  colonnades corridors insulae peristyles (Roman courtyards) triclinia vestibules water wells  Garden Description Insula 30, east of the central baths, was taken up by a single house built around 200 AD. This replaced several earlier structures on the site. The insula, including the street colonnades, had an overall area of ca. 48 x 60 meters.
The house had a peristyle courtyard of rectangular shape which was surrounded on three sides by a low wall supporting stone columns. The courtyard was unpaved and almost certainly planted (G in Fig. 1). Entering the house from the east, one passed through a vestibule before arriving in the peristyle corridor around the courtyard. The courtyard wall, enclosing an area 14 x 23.50 meters in size, was fronted by a water channel. There was a well in the north. From the triclinium to the west of the courtyard, one had a view directly into the courtyard.

Keywords archaeological garden \
 insulae peristyles (Roman courtyards) porticoes terrace gardens  Garden Description This house, built on sloping terrain on the northern edge of the city around AD 150, was enlarged twenty years later to incorporate at least two certain gardens (Fig. 1). It bordered north and south on streets and was flanked on the east and west by other houses. In this last phase after ca. 170, the house covered an area of about 2000 square meters. In the center of the building was an irregular peristyle courtyard, at the north end of which was a private bath complex.
East of the house was a long rectangular area open to the sky and divided into plots by a wall. In the northernmost plot a layer of humic soil 20-40 centimeters thick was excavated that the excavators interpret as evidence for a garden (G on plan).
The northern part of the house facing the street included an open terrace which may have been built up on demolished walls of the earlier house. Humus-rich soil in the terrace area may indicate that it was planted (G in Fig. 1). Immediately south of the terrace was a portico that offered a splendid view of the valley.

These may represent more than one house, or they may be parts of one large house. The southern part of the complex, entered from the colonnaded street on the west, had a vestibule or corridor leading into a peristyle courtyard. This may have been planted, although the excavators could find no clear evidence of this. Beyond the peristyle to the east was a series of rooms, including one large room presumably with representative character, and an open area interpreted as a courtyard or garden (G in Fig. 1). The complex was built at the earliest during the reign of Trajan, but additions and alterations followed throughout the 2nd and perhaps the 3rd century.

Iulius Aquila, and his heirs. The will goes on to provide for annual banquets at the tomb site, to be funded by Aquila and his heirs (not explicitly from proceeds of the orchards), and to ensure that any deviations from the testator’s prescriptions be undertaken only in order that the complex be better adorned, better planted, and better perfected (nisi..ut melius colantur et conserantur perficianturque).

      <description>Province Germania Superior
Province Description The regions on the upper Rhine formally became the province of Germania Superior, Upper Germany, during the reign of Domitian, probably around AD 85. Since the Augustan period, they had formed a military zone on the eastern fringes of Gallia Belgica and Gallica Lugdunensis. Moguntiacum (Mainz) at the confluence of the Rhine and Main rivers was the administrative capital and the site of a legionary base. The province incorporated areas on both sides of the Rhine, the boundaries crossing the Moselle river in the north and reaching in the south as far as Lake Geneva. The areas east of the Rhine extended beyond the Neckar river up to the German limes and its forts, although this region was not organised into civitates until the time of Trajan. The Rhine valley in the northern part of the province, diminished in width by the encroaching Eifel, Voreifel and Pfälzer mountains, opened up west of the river around Mainz to form a broad, fertile landscape, while the valley floor east of the Rhine sloped gently up to the Odenwald mountains. Between the Odenwald and the Taunus range, the Wetterau plain was a densely settled agricultural landscape. The winding Neckar valley equally provided fertile slopes for cultivation. West of the Rhine, the Moselle valley was known for its agricultural productivity and vine-clad slopes. Between the Jura range and the Swiss Alps in the south, the valley of the Aare was sought out for settlement and cultivation. The Alpine passes and the connection of the upper Rhine with the Rhône and Saône rivers assured good trade links with the Mediterranean. Upper Germany was divided during the reign of Diocletian (284-305 AD) into the two provinces of Germania Prima, with its capital at Mainz, and Maxima Sequanorum, with its capital at Besançon.

Keywords  villae rusticae porticoes piscinae hedges courtyards  Garden Description The stone-built structures of this villa rustica near the Meuse river, the largest excavated thus far in the Netherlands, were erected in the early 2nd century and repeatedly enlarged until the abandonment of the farm around 300 A.D. (Plan 1). The total area of the farm, including the cultivated land, is calculated to have been ca. 150 hectares. The main residence (A on plan) lay in the northern half of the complex which measured 167 x 214 m. (3.5 hectares) in size. The porticoed facade in its final state was 190 m. long.
In front of the house to the south was a large area (17 x 37 m.), enclosed by a stone wall on two sides and villa porticoes on the other sides. This has been interpreted as a formal garden (G on plan) with low plantings, hedges and a pool (P on plan; Image 1 [NO IMAGE INCLUDED]). The main road leading from the gate in the south to the house in the north cut through this enclosed area. The excavators postulate a vegetable garden behind the house for easy, daily access. The boundaries of the farm complex were planted with a row of trees or a hedge, the planting pits of which had survived. The many carbonized grains of wheat and chaff found in and around a large building in the northeastern part of the courtyard enclosure suggest that wheat grown in the fields of the farm was processed here. The main crop at Voerendaal was spelt; very little emmer or bread wheat was present in the organic remains.

Keywords  castra praetoriums atriums peristyles (Roman courtyards) tablina pedestals Pliny the Younger  Garden Description In the Neronian fort of the 5th and 15th legions near the civilian settlement of Colonia Ulpia Traiana were two vast buildings on either side of the headquarters building (principia). These were the residences, or praetoria, of the two legionary commanders. The western palatial complex was 76-77 m. in width and 97 m. in length (over 7400 sq. m.) (Plan 1). It was entered from the east through a vestibule and an atrium. The villa had several peristyle courtyards, including one long peristyle courtyard with apsidal ends which has been interpreted as a garden (G on plan). Between the atrium and the apsidal courtyard was a large room, possibly a tablinum or a dining room. This courtyard measured 18.80 x 83 m. and had an open area 10.80 m. wide, surrounded on all sides by a covered columned walkway, 3.50 m. in width.
The partially excavated eastern villa was 78.50 m. wide and 109 m. in length. It too had several peristyle courtyards and one long courtyard 19 x 74.60 m. in size. The open area between the covered walkways was 5.80 m. wide. In front of each of the columns surrounding the courtyard were buttress-like foundations which the excavator interpreted as possible bases for statues. The excavator referred to the long courtyards in these houses as &amp;ldquo;hippodrome gardens&amp;rdquo;, and compared them to known stadium or hippodrome gardens at Pliny&amp;rsquo;s Tuscan villa, on the Palatine in Rome (Domus Augustana) and at Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s villa at Tivoli. The comparison is unacceptable, however, since both ends of the courtyards in the legionary camp are apsidal, unlike a stadium or hippodrome which has one straight end. The long garden courtyards at Xanten may have had more in common with the long, apsidal gardens referred to by Pliny as gestatio in modum circi (Epist. 5.6.17). It can be considered reasonably certain that the courtyards in both legionary villas were not foreseen for races or athletic activities, but for gardens as an ideal place for promenades.

Garden Rustic villa at Rheinbach-Flerzheim
Keywords  villae rusticae hedges bathhouses (water recreation structures) kitchen gardens piscinae  Garden Description There was no division between the residential and service parts of this modest farm. The house, with its bath (A and B on plan), and the outbuildings were built of stone at the beginning of the 2nd century (Plan 1). The winged corridor type house of this villa rustica was 37 m. long and 20 m. wide, and it had a bath attached to the back.
Enclosing the farm complex was a hedge or row of trees, the planting trenches of which were uncovered in excavations (gray wavy border on plan). Based on the palaeobotanical evidence of carbonised plant remains and pollen, a kitchen garden near the house and fruit trees on the property have been reconstructed. In front of the entrance to the main residence at the south were the remains of a small pool lined with clay. This has been taken as evidence for an ornamental garden surrounding the pool. On a farm of this modest size and simplicity, however, an ornamental garden seems rather unlikely. The farm was occupied until the mid-5th century.

Niederzier-Hambach (Pleiades)
Location Description In the Hambacher Forst region, which lies approximately 30-35 km. west of the former capital city Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium (mod. Cologne), a number of modest villae rusticae have been excavated.
Garden Niederzier Hambach 59
Keywords  villae rusticae ditches fences (site elements) hedges water wells orchards cherry (plant)  Garden Description This farm, known as Hambach 59, was built in the late 1st century A.D. and inhabited until its destruction in the 4th century (Plan 1). The farmhouse, 19.50 x 26 m. in size (A on plan), occupied a position in the northern part of the complex, and looked out on the rest of the farm to the south where various outbuildings and stables stood. There was no division between the residential part and the service area of the farm.
The farmyard was enclosed by a hedge (dotted lines on plan) and took up an area of approximately 1.5 hectares. Outside of the enclosed farmyard to the north were four large plots, presumably for orchards and cultivated fields, which were marked off by ditches or fences (outlined in black on plan). Two of these plots were approximately one hectare in size. The reconstruction of the vegetation on the farm is based on the palaeobotanical analysis of deposits from the four wells in front of the house. The material includes charred fruits and seeds as well as unburnt plant remains and pollen. Cherry pits are evidence for sweet cherry trees. Oak pollen, as well as the water-logged remains of the buds and bud scales of the oak tree, suggest that a shady oak may have grown near one of the wells in the courtyard. Walnut pollen was found in such large quantities in the wells, that one can safely assume the presence of walnut trees near the house. The same applies for lime trees attested by their pollen in the sediments. The remains of coriander and linseed in the wells suggest that these plants may have grown in the vegetable garden in the immediate vicinity of the house. The hedge surrounding the farm compound may have consisted of a combination of hazelnut, elderberry, raspberry and brambleberry, which were all present as pollen, shells, and seeds in the sediments. Box is attested by the pollen in the wells, but it is uncertain where this plant grew on the site.

Location Description In the Hambacher Forst region, which lies approximately 30-35 km. west of the former capital city Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium (mod. Cologne), a number of modest villae rusticae have been excavated.
Garden Niederzier Hambach 69
Keywords  villae rusticae fences (site elements) ditches hedges kitchen gardens orchards water wells cherry (plant)  Garden Description This villa rustica was situated west of Cologne in the same region as Hambach 59. It was built in the late 1st century A.D. and inhabited until the 4th century (Plan 1). The farm had a calculated overall area, including the cultivated land, of 50 hectares. The farm compound itself was one hectare in size. The modest house (A on plan) stood just inside the western border of the complex. Elsewhere on the property were various stables, barns, a pond and several wells.
To the east of the house was an area marked off by a narrow ditch (B on plan). This was probably a bedding trench for a protective hedge around a vegetable garden (G on plan). Palaeobotanical material, all of it carbonized, from deposits in wells and pits provide information on the field crops. Considerable amounts of charred chaff in a well in the eastern part of the farmyard suggest that a threshing area for the grain grown on the farm may have been situated near the well. The botanical remains indicate that spelt wheat was the main crop, followed by barley. The farmyard has hedge borders, the planting trenches for which were excavated. Within this area, fruit trees, oaks and alders as well as elderberry bushes possibly were planted.

Keywords  insulae kitchen gardens courtyards  Garden Description Between the buildings were open areas, some paved and equipped with ovens and pottery kilns, wells and latrines, others unpaved. Some of the small courtyards have been reconstructed by the excavators as kitchen gardens and shrine gardens (Image 1). Organic material from a well in this insula included the remains of peas, beans, lentils, apples, pears and herbs. These fruits and vegetables may have grown in kitchen gardens in the insula, but they may, on the other hand, have been brought into the city from nearby farms.

In the leveled remains of the 1st century house were fragments of painted wall plaster, including fragments of scenes depicting gardens (Image 1). These show trees against a sky-blue background. It is uncertain which rooms of the house were decorated in this way.

Garden Urban house on Wolfsstrasse (Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium)
Keywords  urban villas villae urbanae colonnades peristyles (Roman courtyards) mural paintings (visual works)  Garden Description Only a fraction of this house in the immediate vicinity of the House on Gertrudenstraße was excavated. Enough was salvaged, however, to be able to recognize that the house was of the peristyle type (Plan 1). The house was built after the middle of the 1st century A.D. By the mid-4th century the building was ruinous and the stones of most of the walls were robbed for reuse elsewhere.
The peristyle courtyard was ca. 7 m. wide and 11.30 m. long. Both faces of the wall surrounding it were plastered and painted red. Presumably the wall was several courses high, much like a balustrade, with columns on top. There was a doorway or monumental entrance, 3.50 m. wide, to the courtyard at the southeast. The corridor around the garden was 3.10 m. wide and had a beaten earth floor resurfaced more than once. Most of the original earth in the courtyard had been disturbed or removed in post-Roman times, but there was clearly no sign of a paved surface or beaten earth floors that had been trodden in the courtyard, so that one might postulate the existence of loose garden soil here during the occupation of the house (G on Plan 1). In the northern part of the courtyard was a deep, circular shaft which may have been a well (W on Plan 1), the stone courses of which had been robbed out.

The courtyard was unpaved, and the presence of a source of water suggests that it was designed as a garden (G on Plan 1). Although the house was only partially excavated, evidence for several rebuildings from the second half of the 1st to the 4th century was retrieved. The peristyle courtyard was retained throughout, indicating the importance attached to the garden by generations of owners.

      <description>Province Germania inferior
Province Description The Augustan military zone along the lower Rhine was formally reorganized as the province of Germania Inferior, Lower Germany, during the reign of Domitian around A.D. 85. Until this time, the area had been on the eastern fringe of the province of Gallia Belgica
Gallia Belgica (Pleiades). The provincial capital was Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium
Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium (Pleiades) (modern Cologne). Numerous legionary and auxiliary bases fortified the lower Rhine frontier throughout its history. Lower Germany was bounded by the Rhine river in the north, and immediately south of this border lay marshy lowlands and the islands in the delta of the Rhine, Meuse, Waal and Schelde rivers. Northbound ships carrying goods from the interior crossed over from the delta to Britain. The province extended in the west beyond the Meuse River, and ended in the south at the Vinxtbach river. The sandy soils of the northern lowlands were of poor quality for cultivation, but they were well suited to cattle and horse breeding. The loess regions to the south, particularly to the west of the Cologne basin, on the other hand were ideal for agriculture, particularly cereal cultivation. The middle part of the province between Nijmegen and Krefeld was characterized by gentle wooded hills. The rugged Eifel and Ardennes mountains in the south and south-east of the province were mined for ores and stone of varying kinds. During the reign of Domitian (A.D. 284-305), the provincial boundaries were redrawn to extend westwards into areas formerly belonging to Gallia Belgica
Gallia Belgica (Pleiades). The province in its late phase was renamed Germania Secunda.

      <description>Province Dacia Traiana
Province Description Dacia occupied the region occupied by today by Romania, Moldava, and parts of Bulgaria, Serbia, Hungary and the Ukraine. Homeland of the Gatae tribe, it was conquered by the Romans under Trajan in 106 CE. After the Romans retreated from this region in 271-275 CE, they renamed an area of Moesia Superior “Dacia Aureliana”. This entry concerns only original province of Dacia.
The area was known to the Romans prior to its conquest, particularly for its position along the Hercynian Forest (Black Forest). Ruled by king Burebista (82–44 BC), Julius Caesar (De Bello Gallico book 6) describes the kingdom in 53 BC starting on the eastern edge of the Hercynian Forest (Black Forest). Strabo, in his Geography (c. 25 CE) writes:
 As for the southern part of Germany beyond the Albis, the portion which is just contiguous to that river is occupied by the Suevi; then immediately adjoining this is the land of the Getae, which, though narrow at first, stretching as it does along the Ister on its southern side and on the opposite side along the mountain-side of the Hercynian Forest (for the land of the Getae also embraces a part of the mountains), afterwards broadens out towards the north as far as the Tyregetae; but I cannot tell the precise boundaries.
 Both rulers were murdered in the same year, and the kingdom was broken into smaller entities. The states of Dacia recognized Rome’s supremacy under Augustus, and interaction is indicated by Augustus’ betrothal of his daughter to Cotiso. Horace (Occidit Daci Cotisonis agmen, Odes, III. 8. 18).
Dacia was of particular interest to the Romans for its supplies of lead, needed for the water pipes of the cities and villas.

Keywords  archaeological garden axial plan terrace gardens rural villas villae rusticae  Garden Description The main residence of this rural estate in Gloucestershire, excavated in 1882, is of the winged corridor type (Fig. 1). From the north and south corners of the house, walls ran in a westerly direction to enclose an open courtyard (G in Fig. 1) approximately 65 meters wide and 45 meters deep from the outer boundary to the main entrance of the house. A paved path was axially arranged in the courtyard to connect the entrance to the courtyard with that of the residential building. The western third of the courtyard is marked off by low scarps which may be remains of garden terraces (T in Fig. 1). Finds from the site indicate a 3rd/4th century date for the complex.

      <description>Province Judaea
Iudaea (province) (Pleiades)
Province Description Judaea, the Roman province, included parts of the areas of the Hasmonean and Herodium kingdoms, notably Biblical Judah, Samaria, and Edom. Its capital was Caesarea Maritima. Roman influence in the region began in 63 CE, when the Roman general Pompey the Great took over Syria from Mithridates and, coming into Jerusalem, occupied the Second Temple. Pompey appointed Antipater, the father of Herod, as the first Roman Procurator. Later these ties allowed Herod to seek backing from Rome against the Hasmoneans in 40 BCE, when the senate recognized him as “king of the Jews.” His territories came to include the regions of Galilee, Gaulanitis (the Golan),Peraea and the Decapolis. Herod balanced his allegiance to Rome with the independence of his kingdom, often employing architectural projects to express his ambitions and control of nature to express his capacity to rule . His many palaces, placed strategically around the kingdom, feature dramatically designed landscapes and gardens. Upon his death, his heirs were unable to maintain order and Judea was annexed to Syria in 6 CE, although it was assigned its own procurator. By the time of Trajan, Judea was reduced in size and the Herodian palaces abandoned, preserving them over the millennia for archaeologists. Hadrian renamed the province Syria Palaestina after the Bar Kochba revolts (132-135) provoked him to erase the name of Judea.
The period for which we have the richest evidence of a garden culture in this region is during the reign of Herod the Great. A client king of Rome, Herod’s relationships with Mark Antony, Cleopatra, Augustus and Marcus Agrippa and other officials have been preserved in the texts of Flavius Josephus. These constitute a rare record of interactions between Rome and its territories, and provide a valuable context for understanding the trends of design in the early imperial period. The proximity of Judea to Alexandria, whose palaces and gardens lie beneath the modern city and its harbors, may also provide a suggestion of the late Hellenistic garden culture that Romans emulated. Evidence of gardens in the Hasmonean winter palaces at Jericho and the palaces of Hyracanus the Tobiad on the other side of the Jordan Valley provide rare cases where texts can illuminate archaeological evidence. These gardens require further investigation and both are threatened by local development. This geography of Judaea comprises a wide variety of biomes, from richly watered plains of the Galilee and the Jordan, to the semi arid Judean Hills, the humid, fertile coastal plain of the Mediterranean, and the deserts of the Dead Sea valley and the Negev.
Location Ein Gedi
Ein Gedi (Pleiades)
Location Description The balsam groves of the Dead Sea region have been famous since the queen of Sheba (Egypt and Ethiopia) reputedly brought balsam as a gift to King Solomon (1 Kings 10:10; Josephus Ant.8. 6, 5-6.). From the time of Theophrastus, Jericho and Ein Gedi near the Dead Sea were renowned for their watered palm and balsam plantations (paradeisoi), described by Diodorus Siculus, Varro, Strabo, Virgil, Horace, Pausanias, Pliny the Elder, Solinus and Galen. They are described in some detail by Josephus (Antiquitates Judaeorum 14.54), who notes their water supply was destroyed during the Jewish Revolt. The balsam, however, is regarded as extinct and has not been identified archaeobotanically.
Itzar Hirshfeld identified a possible balsam terrace near the oasis of Ein Gedi, along the ancient road that links the palaces at Jericho with the fortress palace at Masada. Further studies were carried out by Guy Stibbel.
The only possible archaeobotanical evidence found to date for the plant itself comes from a cave at Qumran. Porath and Arubas report that a small Herodian-period juglet wrapped in palm fibers and carefully hidden in the rocks contains oil that does not correspond with any known modern oil and is consistent with ancient descriptions of balsam but analysis on the contents was less than conclusive. Date palm remains, by contrast, are commonly seen in the carbonized plant remains found in Jericho, Wadi Qelt, Masada,Kumran, and other excavations in the valley. In an astonishing recent development, botanist Elaine Solowey was able to use growth hormones to activate three dessicated date pits from excavated contexts at Masada. These were C14 dated to the Roman period. One seed successfully grew into a male palm. Subsequent work with desiccated pits from the Kumran area have produced female plants. (Sallon et al. 2020)

Location Caesarea Maritima
Caesarea Maritima (Pleiades)
Location Description Ultimately the capital of the Roman provinces of Judaea and Syria Palestina, the city was built by Herod the Great. He acquired the old Hellenistic city of Strato’s Tower from Octavian as part of a territorial expansion after Actium, and turned the modest natural harbor here into a major port city, laid out on an orthogonal urban plan. Reminiscent of the basilaea of Alexandria, the southern area of the city was devoted to Herod’s seaside palace, in its early phase, and to public entertainment facilities by the time of the city’s opening in 12 BC. Josephus describes the port and the features of the city (AJ 15.9.6.331 and BJ 1.21.5. 408) including an “amphitheatron” and theater in the south, where archaeologists have discovered and restored a stadium and a theater. These are in the area of the archaeological remains of a palace, also noted but not located by Josephus. The city was a successful enterprise, and by the second and third centuries CE the stadium functions had moved inland and expansive villas were constructed over the remains of the stadium. By the Byzantine era, these villas were incorporated into a new praetorium. These palaces and villas have gardens, discovered in varying degrees of preservation, supplied with water through water channels, initially from the aqueduct and later from wells. Upon the destruction of this district of the city, the Arab inhabitants developed gardens amidst the ruins, irrigated by wells and water channels.

Keywords  pleasure garden walled garden  Garden Description Byzantine Law Court and Roof Garden
Architectural analysis and epigraphic finds excavated by Josef Patrich and the Combined Caesarea Excavations suggest that the buildings in the area immediately south of the harbor (Area CC) formed a governmental compound of Roman - Byzantine Caesarea, comprising a Revenue Office (skrinion), a Law Court and adjacent to them an archive or library for judicial and financial records and books. Earlier archaeologists (JECM) had identified this complex as an honorific U-shaped building; however, it is clearly the inverse. Constructed about 200 CE, the Law Court was a vast hall (13 x 18 m.), built on top of four vaults facing west. In the first phase, the hall faced west to the sea and was surrounded on three sides (N, E and S) by a reflection pool. To its east a square fountain was constructed. (Fig.1)
During the second phase, the pool was converted to a roof garden, filled in with the rich, red sandy soil, locally known as hamra (also noted in the upper courtyard at the promontory palace.) The soil was set on a surface of bipedal ceramic tiles (ca. 60 x 50 cm), which in turn were supported on suspensurae of flat sandstone blocks (each 20 x 20 cm and 15 cm thick) supporting the corners of four bipedal tiles. This arrangement formed a separating space between the roof of the vaults and the garden soil, preventing moisture from damaging the ceiling of the vaults (Fig. 2). This arrangement has no known parallels in Israel, but was used over vaults for the gardens of Tiberius on the Palatine in Rome, a form of nemora pensile, or hanging gardens.
During this phase the building looked out over an extended garden on the east side. Here the garden soil (hamra) extended beyond the eastern wall of the former reflection pool to include the square fountain. The garden was irrigated by a water tank (ca. 3 x 3 m.) erected on ground level between the hall and the fountain, the dimensions of which were reduced at this phase. The eastern wall of the reflection pool was partially dismantled to accommodate this tank.
During the third phase, in the 6th century, the entire garden, including the fountain, was covered by a mosaic floor.

Jericho (Pleiades)
Location Description In one of the most beautiful spots of the Eastern Mediterranean, five km west of Jericho, the biblical “city of Palms,” (Deut. 34:3) lie the remains of a royal complex of the late Second Temple Period (the end of the second century B.C. continuing through the mid-first century A.D). Despite their location in the desert some 200 m. below sea level (one of the lowest occupied elevations on earth) these palaces were set amidst an abundance of vegetation and enjoyed a copious supply of water brought from the surrounding hills via water channels. The palaces are dramatically situated along Wadi Qelt where the gorge opens abruptly onto the Jordan Valley floor. (Fig. 1) They were set amidst the large palm and balsam groves for which the valley was famed. Water channels give archaeological evidence of groves to the north of the palace, but literary evidence suggests that royal holdings from Jericho to Ein Gedi were extensive. None of the gardens have been fully excavated, but many have been examined and the presence of rich soil rather than pavement, as well as water channels and ceramic planting pots provide conclusive evidence for the many gardens discussed below.

Keywords  pleasure garden walled garden  Garden Description Herodian First Palace
Herod may have been a regular guest at the Hasmonean palace during his boyhood. Even after he effected his rule in 37 B.C., the Hasmoneans retained possession of their winter palace for a few years, according to Josephus. Artistobulus III was drowned there by Herod’s men when the royal court stayed at the palace as guests of Princess Alexandra, the mother of Aristobulus III and Herod’s wife, Mariamne.
His first palace, excavated in 1951 by J. Pritchard, was located to the south of Wadi Qelt, again, set amidst greenery. (Fig. 7a) The building was rectangular in shape and was built around three sides of a large peristyle garden. The planning of the palace shows a clear relationship to the courtyard; both the large rectangular triclinium and another reception room on the opposite side of the court’s axis, opened onto the peristyle offering the guests a good view of its gardens.
This first palace was “introverted” thus giving expression to Herod’s inferior status in Jericho at that time. The existence of any swimming pools near the building remains an open question, but a huge pool (180 x 150m) was found to the south near the modern settlement of Birket Musa. This pool may have been used for boating and water sports, as well as irrigation.

Keywords  pleasure garden walled garden  Garden Description Herodian Second Palace
The earthquake of 31 B.C. destroyed the Hasmonean palace complex, and the political changes that took place after Actium enabled Herod to gain full possession of the winter palaces. On top of the ruined palaces, he built a new complex (Fig 8). The two pools of the Pool Complex were unified to form a single, large pool (32 x 18m)! Gardens replaced the pavements around the pool, as evidenced by rows of ceramic planting pots found there. (Fig. 9) On the western side of the pool (A (B) 2), two rows of planting pots ran parallel to the pool. the distance between each pot was about two and a half meters apart while on the eastern side of the pool (A (B) 3) the pots were spaced about one meter apart. Colonnades were built around the larger of these pools and a hall was built on the western side (F), probably meant for the swimmers. A long, narrow Roman-style bath house was built to the west of this pool.
The main unit of the second palace included two wings. The northern wing, was elevated 5 meters above the southern wing and was built around a fairly large peristyle courtyard (34 x 28), flanked by rooms on three sides. The courtyard itself had an unusual structure. Its plan features a regular peristyle but the level of the open courtyard is c. 1 m. higher than that of the floors of the surrounding colonnades (Fig 10). Anyone walking around the courtyard would have seen, and perhaps even smelled, the flowering shrubs directly in front of them. Adjusted to the raised Peristyle garden was a triclinium, ornamented with wall panels and incorporated a window with a view onto the garden. Southern to the triclinium was a colonnaded balcony that overlooked the lower wing of the palace and a dramatic view of Wadi Qelt. The low wing of the palace (Fig 8, AK) incorporated the two Hasmonean swimming pools (one 20 x 20 m. and 7 x 7 m). Colonnades were built around the larger of the pools and a hall was built on the western side, probably meant for the swimmers. A long, narrow Roman-style bath house was built to the west of this pool.

      <description>Province Judaea
Iudaea (province) (Pleiades)
Province Description Judaea, the Roman province, included parts of the areas of the Hasmonean and Herodium kingdoms, notably Biblical Judah, Samaria, and Edom. Its capital was Caesarea Maritima. Roman influence in the region began in 63 CE, when the Roman general Pompey the Great took over Syria from Mithridates and, coming into Jerusalem, occupied the Second Temple. Pompey appointed Antipater, the father of Herod, as the first Roman Procurator. Later these ties allowed Herod to seek backing from Rome against the Hasmoneans in 40 BCE, when the senate recognized him as “king of the Jews.” His territories came to include the regions of Galilee, Gaulanitis (the Golan),Peraea and the Decapolis. Herod balanced his allegiance to Rome with the independence of his kingdom, often employing architectural projects to express his ambitions and control of nature to express his capacity to rule . His many palaces, placed strategically around the kingdom, feature dramatically designed landscapes and gardens. Upon his death, his heirs were unable to maintain order and Judea was annexed to Syria in 6 CE, although it was assigned its own procurator. By the time of Trajan, Judea was reduced in size and the Herodian palaces abandoned, preserving them over the millennia for archaeologists. Hadrian renamed the province Syria Palaestina after the Bar Kochba revolts (132-135) provoked him to erase the name of Judea.
The period for which we have the richest evidence of a garden culture in this region is during the reign of Herod the Great. A client king of Rome, Herod’s relationships with Mark Antony, Cleopatra, Augustus and Marcus Agrippa and other officials have been preserved in the texts of Flavius Josephus. These constitute a rare record of interactions between Rome and its territories, and provide a valuable context for understanding the trends of design in the early imperial period. The proximity of Judea to Alexandria, whose palaces and gardens lie beneath the modern city and its harbors, may also provide a suggestion of the late Hellenistic garden culture that Romans emulated. Evidence of gardens in the Hasmonean winter palaces at Jericho and the palaces of Hyracanus the Tobiad on the other side of the Jordan Valley provide rare cases where texts can illuminate archaeological evidence. These gardens require further investigation and both are threatened by local development. This geography of Judaea comprises a wide variety of biomes, from richly watered plains of the Galilee and the Jordan, to the semi arid Judean Hills, the humid, fertile coastal plain of the Mediterranean, and the deserts of the Dead Sea valley and the Negev.
Location Jericho
Jericho (Pleiades)
Location Description In one of the most beautiful spots of the Eastern Mediterranean, five km west of Jericho, the biblical “city of Palms,” (Deut. 34:3) lie the remains of a royal complex of the late Second Temple Period (the end of the second century B.C. continuing through the mid-first century A.D). Despite their location in the desert some 200 m. below sea level (one of the lowest occupied elevations on earth) these palaces were set amidst an abundance of vegetation and enjoyed a copious supply of water brought from the surrounding hills via water channels. The palaces are dramatically situated along Wadi Qelt where the gorge opens abruptly onto the Jordan Valley floor. (Fig. 1) They were set amidst the large palm and balsam groves for which the valley was famed. Water channels give archaeological evidence of groves to the north of the palace, but literary evidence suggests that royal holdings from Jericho to Ein Gedi were extensive. None of the gardens have been fully excavated, but many have been examined and the presence of rich soil rather than pavement, as well as water channels and ceramic planting pots provide conclusive evidence for the many gardens discussed below.
Sublocation Herodian Entertainment Complex, Third Palace
Sublocation Description The third palace built by Herod in the late first century B.C. merits special mention with regard to the integration of water, gardens and landscape. This palace was sited along a straight section of Wadi Qelt to take advantage of its season flow of water each winter. This area was, however, lower than those on which the first and second palaces had been built, offering a more limited view of the surroundings. This shortcoming was offset by the erection of a viewing pavilion on top of an artificial tel. The overall building complex was rectilinear, with Wadi Qelt cutting through the center, and a bridge spanning the two halves. On the north side lay a complex of banqueting rooms, Roman style baths, reception rooms, peristyle courtyards and colonnaded walks. On the south lay a great sunken garden, the artificial tel and pavilion, and, off-axis, a shallow boating pool. (Fig. 11) The garden features are discussed individually below.
Garden Royal Garden
Keywords  pleasure garden walled garden  Garden Description Corinthian Peristyle
With porticoes on three sides and measuring 23 x 14.5m, this courtyard, known as area B55, is decorated with columns in the Corinthian order. (Fig. 16) The lower portions of these smooth stucco shafts alternate between red and black; above them the columns are of fluted white stucco while the Corinthian capitals are of stone. Thus far, no entablature or roof tiles have been discovered. A low stone wall, known as a pluteus, ran between the columns. Water entered the garden at the north end, under the pluteus from the aqueduct channel serving the adjacent baths. As with garden B64, an opus signinum walk runs along the exterior perimeter of the porticoes. The ridged surface of the garden lies 12cm below the surrounding walk, which is neatly finished with a curb. The ridges are of packed earth, 3 or 4cm in depth, with no trace of plaster or mortar; and whereas in garden B64 there is a covering layer of fertilized soil, in B55 the ridges are exposed. Beneath the packed surface, lies coarse gravel, perhaps equivalent to the subsoil or fill in B64. No perforated pots were found. The only evidence of ornamentation within the garden is a large boulder, centrally placed and apparently part of the garden scheme rather than fallen debris. Along the curb, layers of mineral deposit were excavated from very fine silt sand. In some respects, this courtyard has the appearance of a pool, although its surfaces are not sealed with the grey hydraulic plaster usually employed in water features elsewhere in the palace complex. The nature of this courtyard remains uncertain pending further excavation, but the mouth of a water channel on the north end and the accreted mineral deposit such either a water feature or displays of plants receiving heavy irrigation.

This palace was sited along a straight section of Wadi Qelt to take advantage of its season flow of water each winter. This area was, however, lower than those on which the first and second palaces had been built, offering a more limited view of the surroundings. This shortcoming was offset by the erection of a viewing pavilion on top of an artificial tel. The overall building complex was rectilinear, with Wadi Qelt cutting through the center, and a bridge spanning the two halves. On the north side lay a complex of banqueting rooms, Roman style baths, reception rooms, peristyle courtyards and colonnaded walks. On the south lay a great sunken garden, the artificial tel and pavilion, and, off-axis, a shallow boating pool. (Fig. 6) The garden features are discussed individually below.
Garden Royal Garden
Keywords  pleasure garden walled garden  Garden Description Ionic Peristyle
This peristyle courtyard (19.1 x 18.7) lies adjacent to the banquet hall and near Roman baths constructed in opus reticulatum. It is referred to in excavation reports as area B64. The central garden is surrounded on three sides by a colonnade of cemented stone, stuccoed in white and red. Remains of plaster Ionic capitals and other stucco decoration were found during excavation, as well as frescoes with floral motifs of unusually high quality, perhaps made by Roman craftsmen. Rozenberg claimed that this courtyard was the most richly painted space in the palace An unusual feature of the peristyles in this complex is an opus signinum walk around the inner circumference of the peristyle, outside the columns flanking the garden.
The garden was first discovered in 1976 by E. Netzer, who excavated a trench through the center of the peristyle. The garden soil was poorly preserved, but ceramic planting pots appeared at the bottom of the garden. In 1985 and 1987, K. Gleason continued the excavations and found preserved garden soil layers beneath the destruction debris at the sides of the garden. (Fig. 13) The stratigraphy is reconstructed as follows:
The subsoil, probably fill, is composed of coarse, poorly cemented alluvial pebbles and cobbles. Above this, a thin layer of soil, in most places, plastered over, formed a rough surface over the courtyard, except at the north end, where the plaster tapers off onto a packed earth surface. The crude quality of the plaster and varying types of mortar suggest a working surface for the construction of the peristyle. When the garden was installed, trenches extending down into the subsoil levels were cut out of the plaster surface for the pots and planting pits. (Fig. 14) The flower pots at Jericho are unusual among Roman era pots. They are well-formed of local clay with a hole in the bottom and three holes in the side of the vessel, neatly punched before firing. Their similarity to local water-wheel pots is striking, except that in the planting pot the knob-like foot is open, like a bottle top, while closed in the water wheel pots. The Mishnah suggests that perforated pots, with holes in the bottom and sides, allowed the plants inside to make contact with the ground and thus allow plants or seeds in the pot to be considered like plants in the ground in most matters of agricultural law (Mishnah 8 in Kil’ayim), purity (eg Uktzin 1.9-10), and tithing (Gitin 21b-22a). The rabbis, at least during the redaction of the Mishnah, found that flower pots posed fascinating problems for interpretation.
The plantings were aligned in rows, roughly 1.5m apart. Between the rows, ridges were formed of small cobbles crudely plastered over, apparently to direct the flow of irrigation water. At the north end the situation appears to be somewhat different. The ridges characteristic of the plastered surface end approximately 2m from the walk in front of the apse. In this area only one pot was found, but late in excavation, after light rainfall, three planting pits became evident. These were filled with a light sandy loam, and two were free of flower-pot sherds. The fertilized garden soil was then laid over the whole area, 8-10cm deep and surrounding the pots, but only on the surface of the planting pits.
The plan reveals seven rows of up to eleven pots per row, although directly in front of the apse, tree pits were observed in place of the pots. This regular ordering of rows seems peculiar in such a public location, as Roman gardens of this period could be quite ornate in their layout. A garden at Pompeii laid out in such straight rows would be a market garden. However, the older, Hellenistic and Persian preference is for straight rows, and it is possible that this is a display garden for miniaturized plants (Langgut and Gleason).

This palace was sited along a straight section of Wadi Qelt to take advantage of its season flow of water each winter. This area was, however, lower than those on which the first and second palaces had been built, offering a more limited view of the surroundings. This shortcoming was offset by the erection of a viewing pavilion on top of an artificial tel. The overall building complex was rectilinear, with Wadi Qelt cutting through the center, and a bridge spanning the two halves. On the north side lay a complex of banqueting rooms, Roman style baths, reception rooms, peristyle courtyards and colonnaded walks. On the south lay a great sunken garden, the artificial tel and pavilion, and, off-axis, a shallow boating pool. (Fig. 6) The garden features are discussed individually below.
Garden Royal Garden
Keywords  pleasure garden walled garden  Garden Description Sunken Garden
The monumental ‘sunken garden’ (B6), which measures 37.27 x 113.67m, lies largely unexcavated on the south side of Wadi Qelt, in alignment with the buildings and gardens described above (Fig 17). First explored in 1950 by Kelso and Baramki and again by Netzer in 1979, its perimeter is known, although the northern side has eroded into the wadi. Kelso and Baramki found a retaining wall on the south side, set into the slope of the hill and presenting a “grand facade” of semicircular and squared niches separated by columns in antis (fig 18). Jewish Law would have prohibited the placement of statuary in these niches, but urns with plants may have provided a satisfactory alternative and Stibel suggests that it served as a luxurious nympheum. The facade is interrupted in the middle by a great hemicycle (Fig 19), which formed a small stepped theatre, with benches not for spectators but for plants in perforated ceramic pots of the same general size and description as those found in garden B64 and elsewhere in the winter palace complex (Fig 20). A water channel ran along the floor of the sunken garden across entire length of the facade and cavea. Double porticoes along the top of the retaining walls, preserved on the east and west sides, allowed visitors to promenade around the sunken garden and look into it; what they observed remains buried beneath a deep landslide. In 1978, Netzer cut a trial trench along the foot of the east retaining wall and discovered a perforated pot at this lower level. (Fig. 21 and 22) Gleason examined the stratigraphy of this sounding in 1985 and noted that the pot was set into a level of cultivated soil.
Elevated Pavilion
Above the east end of the sunken garden rises the artificial tel with its pavilion, another unusual feature of Herod’s palace. The pavilion was round, 16 m. in diameter, serving as a reception hall with four niches in each quarter. Below the hall, as seen in the northern palace at Masada, lay a Roman-style bathhouse for the pleasure of guests visiting the hall. The artificial mount was undoubtedly erected to offer splendid views of the landscape with its oasis estates of rare palms and balsam, and would, in turn, be a landmark visible from the road descending from Wadi Qelt and from across the plain.
Boating Pool
A huge pool (90 x 40 m.) built to the east of the sunken garden formed an integral part of the third palace. The pool probably served not only for swimming but also for boating and aquatic sports. In contrast to all the other wings of the third palace, which were built in alignment with a single grid system, this pool deviates by c. 30 to accommodate the slope of the hill, evidently to offer spectators a good view of the events. The difference in orientation was possibly obscured by trees and shrubs, was the case with the Pool Complex of the second palace.

      <description>Province Judaea
Iudaea (province) (Pleiades)
Province Description Judaea, the Roman province, included parts of the areas of the Hasmonean and Herodium kingdoms, notably Biblical Judah, Samaria, and Edom. Its capital was Caesarea Maritima. Roman influence in the region began in 63 CE, when the Roman general Pompey the Great took over Syria from Mithridates and, coming into Jerusalem, occupied the Second Temple. Pompey appointed Antipater, the father of Herod, as the first Roman Procurator. Later these ties allowed Herod to seek backing from Rome against the Hasmoneans in 40 BCE, when the senate recognized him as “king of the Jews.” His territories came to include the regions of Galilee, Gaulanitis (the Golan),Peraea and the Decapolis. Herod balanced his allegiance to Rome with the independence of his kingdom, often employing architectural projects to express his ambitions and control of nature to express his capacity to rule . His many palaces, placed strategically around the kingdom, feature dramatically designed landscapes and gardens. Upon his death, his heirs were unable to maintain order and Judea was annexed to Syria in 6 CE, although it was assigned its own procurator. By the time of Trajan, Judea was reduced in size and the Herodian palaces abandoned, preserving them over the millennia for archaeologists. Hadrian renamed the province Syria Palaestina after the Bar Kochba revolts (132-135) provoked him to erase the name of Judea.
The period for which we have the richest evidence of a garden culture in this region is during the reign of Herod the Great. A client king of Rome, Herod’s relationships with Mark Antony, Cleopatra, Augustus and Marcus Agrippa and other officials have been preserved in the texts of Flavius Josephus. These constitute a rare record of interactions between Rome and its territories, and provide a valuable context for understanding the trends of design in the early imperial period. The proximity of Judea to Alexandria, whose palaces and gardens lie beneath the modern city and its harbors, may also provide a suggestion of the late Hellenistic garden culture that Romans emulated. Evidence of gardens in the Hasmonean winter palaces at Jericho and the palaces of Hyracanus the Tobiad on the other side of the Jordan Valley provide rare cases where texts can illuminate archaeological evidence. These gardens require further investigation and both are threatened by local development. This geography of Judaea comprises a wide variety of biomes, from richly watered plains of the Galilee and the Jordan, to the semi arid Judean Hills, the humid, fertile coastal plain of the Mediterranean, and the deserts of the Dead Sea valley and the Negev.

Herod the Great’s primary residence and burial place appears to have been this large palace complex 15 km southwest of Jerusalem. Here his court was within easy reach of the city, and on clear days the palace and the Mt. of Olives are visible in both directions. Herodium was an entirely new administrative and residential complex, commemorating his military victory over Antigonus for control of Jerusalem in 40 BCE. Herodium was begun c. 23-20 BC and offered a Herod a range of facilities in which he could perhaps live and conduct business more freely here than in Jerusalem. (Jewish Antiquities, XV, 323-325) The palace has two primary residential areas: the fortified palace atop a natural, but raised hilltop; and an unfortified palace that spans a gentle valley below. (Fig. 1) (Josephus Jewish War I, 419-421; Jewish Antiquities, XV, 323-325).

In 2005, Netzer’s team found the long-sought tomb of Herod, positioned on a terrace constructed into the slope of the artificial hill. This terrace was constructed of chipped stone and construction debris, largely the light limestone of the area. To the front and sides of the tomb, a layer of rich brown loam, similar to that found in the other garden areas, clearly indicated a garden. (Fig. 4) A small pool with lead piping was found to the side of the terrace. Although the lead pipes had been robbed, the pool evidently watered the terraced gardens (fig 1B, 2, and 3)

Lower Herodium (Fig. 1C) comprises several units. Here the central focus is the large pool, the water of which was supplied by a 6 km long aqueduct built by Herod from the spring at the modern village of Artas. The pool is set into a huge garden terrace 120 X 110 m. in size. It was constructed by blocking and leveling a whole section of a valley with up to 8 m of fill. A stepped retaining wall, like a dam, supports the terrace to the east of the garden, as well as two long halls, one on the garden level and the other below, looking down the valley. The garden itself is surrounded on three sides (north, west and south) by wide colonnades situated about 1.5m higher than the garden. The pool was probably used for swimming, for small boats, as a water reservoir, and as a central architectural focus at “the heart” of Lower Herodium. A tholos-type pavilion topped the circular stone foundation (13.5 m in diameter) exposed in the center of the pool. The majority of the buildings at Lower Herodium, still largely unexcavated, are laid out in a “U” shaped cluster around this large garden.
A limited examination of the courtyard area by K. Gleason in December 1985 supports the theory that the courtyard was planted, although it may have had substantial areas with plastered walks and seating areas, as one might expect around a pool. Immediately below the plaster surface, above the terrace fill, a rich, mottled loam with potsherds, suitable for cultivation was identified, suggesting either an earlier garden planted over the entire area, or simply a soil layer that permitted trees and shrubs to be planted within an overall scheme of trees, shrubs, and paved places for bathers to relax. Small test trenches did not reveal any planting pits; however, the rich soil was seen in the stratigraphy of earlier trenches throughout the site suggesting shaded smooth plastered surfaces and probable areas of garden beds.

Location Masada
Masada (Pleiades)
Location Description Masada, originally a Hasmonean defensive post, was the refuge for Herod’s family during the journey to Rome that led to his kingship. They nearly perished of thirst, but the winter rains arrived to fill the cisterns at the last possible moment. (Josephus, Jewish Antiquities XIV. 358-60; 391) Once Herod consolidated his power, he turned this barren desert mountaintop into a luxurious oasis palace overlooking the Dead Sea (Josephus Jewish War VII, 289-291.) (Fig. 1) The site is more famous as the last stand of the Zealots during the Jewish Revolt of AD 66 and remains of Roman forts surround the palace on the lower slopes and valley floor.
The earliest phases of Herodian building are seen in the Western Palace area. These buildings are architecturally similar to the Hasmonean palaces at Jericho and include the garden features of the southern area of the mountain top: water channels, cisterns, two swimming pools, and a columbarium. Gleason has studied the garden area briefly in 1990 and 1996 and found evidence of garden soil fertilized with domestic debris including potsherds. (Fig. 2) The sherd scatters are the main remaining evidence of this soil. It is possible that when the Zealots built the earthen fortification on the last night of the siege that the soils of the gardens may have been the quickest to remove. This or wind erosion appears to have removed any trace of the hilltop “being of rich soils…softer than any plain and given up to cultivation.” The potsherd types indicate that the garden area was cultivated by both Herod and the Zealots. There is no evidence of cultivation in the south area during the Byzantine period. Aerial photographs dating prior to the excavations may suggest that the gardens were laid out and managed in the manner of Nabataean desert agriculture in the region and future work at the site may shed further light on the layout of the garden.
The Northern or Hanging Palace, the latest of Herod’s constructions on the site, is a spectacular feature of architecture, engineering and landscape architecture. A series of platforms were created by alternately creating retaining walls and carving into the precipitous northern face of the mountain. On these platforms, he built a series of pavilions for dining, reception, baths and guest quarters. The contrast between the interior luxury of these rooms and the brilliant and utterly desolate landscape of the Dead Sea is sublime. Room xxx, in particular, sheltered guests amidst frescos of garden foliage (Fig. 3) and only steps away presented a spectacular overlook of the desert view. Herod’s reputation for “defying nature” (Josephus xx) is nowhere more refined than in this complex.

Keywords  pleasure garden walled garden  Garden Description Palace Fortress
The Palace Fortress is a cylindrical structure originally seven stories high (two vaulted corridors in the substructure and five stories of corridors each having its floors supported on wooden beams). In the open interior of the cylinder, palace quarters were designed with luxuriously appointed rooms facing onto a 41x18m courtyard (Fig 1A). These included a triclinium/reception hall, baths, and living quarters. This peristyle featured colonnaded corridors on three of its sides, the two shorter of which were decorated by exedra. The interior focal point for these rooms was a garden, which has been excavated to approximately its original surface. The soil of the garden is clearly amended with fertilizer and suitable for cultivation using water from the cisterns beneath the palace, but the garden features have not yet been excavated.

Location Jericho
Jericho (Pleiades)
Location Description In one of the most beautiful spots of the Eastern Mediterranean, five km west of Jericho, the biblical “city of Palms,” (Deut. 34:3) lie the remains of a royal complex of the late Second Temple Period (the end of the second century B.C. continuing through the mid-first century A.D). Despite their location in the desert some 200 m. below sea level (one of the lowest occupied elevations on earth) these palaces were set amidst an abundance of vegetation and enjoyed a copious supply of water brought from the surrounding hills via water channels. The palaces are dramatically situated along Wadi Qelt where the gorge opens abruptly onto the Jordan Valley floor. (Fig. 1) They were set amidst the large palm and balsam groves for which the valley was famed. Water channels give archaeological evidence of groves to the north of the palace, but literary evidence suggests that royal holdings from Jericho to Ein Gedi were extensive. None of the gardens have been fully excavated, but many have been examined and the presence of rich soil rather than pavement, as well as water channels and ceramic planting pots provide conclusive evidence for the many gardens discussed below.

Erected on the southern margin of the royal estate around 120 B.C., north of Wadi Qelt, the palace has not yet been studied in its entirety, since at a later stage most of it was buried (Fig 2 area AA). At its center lay a courtyard measuring (25 x 18m) flanked by rooms on three sides, probably bedrooms and reception rooms. Although the inner courtyard lacked any archaeological evidence for vegetation, sections of walls and clay pipes suggest that the building was surrounded by orchards and gardens, some of which might have been formal.
Over the years, two swimming pools (probably one for men and one for women), each measuring 10 x 9 m. and 3 m. deep, were added to the palace building (Fig 2 area AB). Each pool had a broad flight of stairs along one of its sidewalls leading down to the bottom, and both had benches built into the tops of the side walls. The pools were probably surrounded by paved plazas with installations for the use of the bathers.

Iudaea (province) (Pleiades)
Province Description Judaea, the Roman province, included parts of the areas of the Hasmonean and Herodium kingdoms, notably Biblical Judah, Samaria, and Edom. Its capital was Caesarea Maritima. Roman influence in the region began in 63 CE, when the Roman general Pompey the Great took over Syria from Mithridates and, coming into Jerusalem, occupied the Second Temple. Pompey appointed Antipater, the father of Herod, as the first Roman Procurator. Later these ties allowed Herod to seek backing from Rome against the Hasmoneans in 40 BCE, when the senate recognized him as “king of the Jews.” His territories came to include the regions of Galilee, Gaulanitis (the Golan),Peraea and the Decapolis. Herod balanced his allegiance to Rome with the independence of his kingdom, often employing architectural projects to express his ambitions and control of nature to express his capacity to rule . His many palaces, placed strategically around the kingdom, feature dramatically designed landscapes and gardens. Upon his death, his heirs were unable to maintain order and Judea was annexed to Syria in 6 CE, although it was assigned its own procurator. By the time of Trajan, Judea was reduced in size and the Herodian palaces abandoned, preserving them over the millennia for archaeologists. Hadrian renamed the province Syria Palaestina after the Bar Kochba revolts (132-135) provoked him to erase the name of Judea.
The period for which we have the richest evidence of a garden culture in this region is during the reign of Herod the Great. A client king of Rome, Herod’s relationships with Mark Antony, Cleopatra, Augustus and Marcus Agrippa and other officials have been preserved in the texts of Flavius Josephus. These constitute a rare record of interactions between Rome and its territories, and provide a valuable context for understanding the trends of design in the early imperial period. The proximity of Judea to Alexandria, whose palaces and gardens lie beneath the modern city and its harbors, may also provide a suggestion of the late Hellenistic garden culture that Romans emulated. Evidence of gardens in the Hasmonean winter palaces at Jericho and the palaces of Hyracanus the Tobiad on the other side of the Jordan Valley provide rare cases where texts can illuminate archaeological evidence. These gardens require further investigation and both are threatened by local development. This geography of Judaea comprises a wide variety of biomes, from richly watered plains of the Galilee and the Jordan, to the semi arid Judean Hills, the humid, fertile coastal plain of the Mediterranean, and the deserts of the Dead Sea valley and the Negev.
Location Jericho
Jericho (Pleiades)
Location Description In one of the most beautiful spots of the Eastern Mediterranean, five km west of Jericho, the biblical “city of Palms,” (Deut. 34:3) lie the remains of a royal complex of the late Second Temple Period (the end of the second century B.C. continuing through the mid-first century A.D). Despite their location in the desert some 200 m. below sea level (one of the lowest occupied elevations on earth) these palaces were set amidst an abundance of vegetation and enjoyed a copious supply of water brought from the surrounding hills via water channels. The palaces are dramatically situated along Wadi Qelt where the gorge opens abruptly onto the Jordan Valley floor. (Fig. 1) They were set amidst the large palm and balsam groves for which the valley was famed. Water channels give archaeological evidence of groves to the north of the palace, but literary evidence suggests that royal holdings from Jericho to Ein Gedi were extensive. None of the gardens have been fully excavated, but many have been examined and the presence of rich soil rather than pavement, as well as water channels and ceramic planting pots provide conclusive evidence for the many gardens discussed below.

The ascent to the throne of Alexander Jannaeus in 103 B.C. triggered a significant development in the above palace. He constructed another conduit from the “Auja and Na’aran” springs to the north of the palace site, which improved the gardens and bathing facilities. Immediately to the east of the palace, he built a new complex of two swimming pools, each measuring 18 x 13 m., surrounded by paved plazas, and a pavilion to the south of the pools. These elements were surrounded by formal gardens, some of which were peripheral, while others were independent units. The largest of all (70 x 60 m.) was surrounded by colonnades. This splendid layout was built along an axis of symmetry, with the pavilion at one end and a peristyle courtyard at the other end. This may be the first archaeological evidence in the Hellenistic-Roman world of an architectural complex whose main function was to provide bathing and swimming facilities.
By 90 BCE, Jannaeus was experiencing political and military difficulties, and it seems that vacations in Jericho had become dangerous. To address security problems, he buried the palace of his father and on top of it he built an elevated, fortified palace surrounded by a moat. The new building offered the advantages of better views across the renowned estate of palm and balsam groves and greater exposure to breezes.

Location Caesarea Maritima
Caesarea Maritima (Pleiades)
Location Description Ultimately the capital of the Roman provinces of Judaea and Syria Palestina, the city was built by Herod the Great. He acquired the old Hellenistic city of Strato’s Tower from Octavian as part of a territorial expansion after Actium, and turned the modest natural harbor here into a major port city, laid out on an orthogonal urban plan. Reminiscent of the basilaea of Alexandria, the southern area of the city was devoted to Herod’s seaside palace, in its early phase, and to public entertainment facilities by the time of the city’s opening in 12 BC. Josephus describes the port and the features of the city (AJ 15.9.6.331 and BJ 1.21.5. 408) including an “amphitheatron” and theater in the south, where archaeologists have discovered and restored a stadium and a theater. These are in the area of the archaeological remains of a palace, also noted but not located by Josephus. The city was a successful enterprise, and by the second and third centuries CE the stadium functions had moved inland and expansive villas were constructed over the remains of the stadium. By the Byzantine era, these villas were incorporated into a new praetorium. These palaces and villas have gardens, discovered in varying degrees of preservation, supplied with water through water channels, initially from the aqueduct and later from wells. Upon the destruction of this district of the city, the Arab inhabitants developed gardens amidst the ruins, irrigated by wells and water channels.

Keywords  pleasure garden walled garden  Garden Description Promontory Palace of Herod the Great
A seaside palace west of the theater at Caesarea Maritima has been identified by E. Netzer as the maritime palace Herod the Great built to supervise construction of the great harbor, and, later, to provide reception space for guests at spectacles and official functions. (Fig. 1) The view north from this promontory became increasingly impressive as the harbor was completed and thrived. The palace served as the official praetorium of his heirs and subsequent Roman officials. Lower Promontory Excavations in the 1970s by Netzer and Lee I. Levine in the lower area of the palace revealed a series of luxurious reception rooms and heated chambers centering on a large (35 x 18 m.) rock-cut swimming pool enclosed by a colonnade. Cuttings in the bedrock between the columns suggested to Netzer that planters had been built between the columns, offering a pluteus around the pool, as well as a planting area protected from the salt spray. (Fig. 2) Upper Palace Excavations by K. Gleason and B. Burrell for the University of Pennsylvania Museum (1990-1996), in collaboration with E. Netzer and Hebrew University; and by Y. Porath of the Israel Antiquities Authority (1993-1996), have revealed an upper, more public half of the palace connected to the stadium (also referred to as an amphitheater by Porath following Josephus) and the theater. The upper palace comprised a series of baths and reception rooms facing out onto a quadriportico (42 x 65 m.) Although the courtyard was paved in plastered crushed sandstone in later Roman phases, fragmentary areas of layers of rich red sand (hamra), popular today with gardeners, were used to level many areas of the courtyard and may indicate the presence of vegetation or a gardened area in the first Herodian period and possibly a gardened courtyard in the first phase of the upper palace’s peristyle courtyard, but soil pits and other planting features were not preserved in any detectable pattern. (Fig. 3) Pollen extracted from plaster on the kurkar columns of the surrounding colonnade included taxa likely to have been growing within the courtyard: Cypress (Cupressus&amp;ndash;either juniperus or sempervirens), hazelnut (Corylus, a non-native), and the herbaceous taxa, Brassicacaea, Salvia, and Cistus (Fig. 4). A fourth century AD well briefly supplied water for the courtyard. Curse tablets (defixiones) at the bottom of this well indicate the popular practice of wishing ill, rather than wishing well.
Foundations of garden architecture, water channels and garden soils of the late Byzantine period have also been found, best preserved in the eastern half of the site.

Garden Villae Rusticae
Keywords  villae rusticae  Garden Description Probable garden soils have been identified in a partially excavated palatial complex from the Herodian period. (Fig. 1) The fortified residential complex is a huge square covering an area of over 5,000 square meters. Towers stood in the four corners of the precinct, which thus appears to have been what was called in the Hellenistic period a tetrapyrgion- type palace. Josephus also uses the term in describing the palace at Masada (Wars 7, 289). This is the best preserved example known to date in Palestine. The palace’s inhabitants were probably members of Jewish elite during and after Herod’s reign, as the complex was abandoned during the great Revolt.
The villa shows the range of indications of Hellenistic and Roman cultural influences of Herod’s time: a columbarium, areas of cultivated soils near the building, water channels, and a heated bathhouse of the Roman style. Amended cultivated soils have also been noted in other areas of the palace building complex, which will be investigated in future seasons.

Keywords  archaeological garden fences (site elements) flower gardens orchards rural villas vegetable gardens villae rusticae  Garden Description Excavations at this country house in Buckinghamshire have produced evidence for gardens adjacent to the main residence in its latest phase dating to the beginning of the 4th century (Fig. 1). The house at the west is of the winged corridor type, fronted by a large courtyard bisected by a paved central drive with a banked edge. Between the outer courtyard wall and the house were areas used for gardening (G in Fig. 1). Just inside the outer yard wall on the south side of the drive traces of at least six bedding trenches cut into the natural subsoil and running parallel to each other were followed for at least 5 meters (b in Fig. 1). These have been interpreted by the excavator as the remains of vegetable gardens (Fig. 2). He also attributed a number of stake holes in this area to small fences bounding the vegetable gardens, and suggested the possibility of an orchard on the northern side of the drive as well as a formal flower garden nearer to the house between the projecting wings, for which there is no concrete archaeological evidence. Finally a small pit just inside the courtyard gateway may represent a pit dug to take one of a pair of trees flanking the entrance.

The proximity of Judea to Alexandria, whose palaces and gardens lie beneath the modern city and its harbors, may also provide a suggestion of the late Hellenistic garden culture that Romans emulated. Evidence of gardens in the Hasmonean winter palaces at Jericho and the palaces of Hyracanus the Tobiad on the other side of the Jordan Valley provide rare cases where texts can illuminate archaeological evidence. These gardens require further investigation and both are threatened by local development. This geography of Judaea comprises a wide variety of biomes, from richly watered plains of the Galilee and the Jordan, to the semi arid Judean Hills, the humid, fertile coastal plain of the Mediterranean, and the deserts of the Dead Sea valley and the Negev.

Jericho (Pleiades)
Location Description In one of the most beautiful spots of the Eastern Mediterranean, five km west of Jericho, the biblical “city of Palms,” (Deut. 34:3) lie the remains of a royal complex of the late Second Temple Period (the end of the second century B.C. continuing through the mid-first century A.D). Despite their location in the desert some 200 m. below sea level (one of the lowest occupied elevations on earth) these palaces were set amidst an abundance of vegetation and enjoyed a copious supply of water brought from the surrounding hills via water channels. The palaces are dramatically situated along Wadi Qelt where the gorge opens abruptly onto the Jordan Valley floor. (Fig. 1) They were set amidst the large palm and balsam groves for which the valley was famed. Water channels give archaeological evidence of groves to the north of the palace, but literary evidence suggests that royal holdings from Jericho to Ein Gedi were extensive. None of the gardens have been fully excavated, but many have been examined and the presence of rich soil rather than pavement, as well as water channels and ceramic planting pots provide conclusive evidence for the many gardens discussed below.
Garden Royal Garden
Keywords  pleasure garden walled garden  Garden Description Twin Palaces of Alexandra Salome and Late Hasmonean Gardens
The trend toward formal gardens and swimming pools at the palace complex gained new expression during the reign of Janneaus’ widow, 76 to 32 B.C.E. Two identical structures built at this time, sharing a common wall, appear to have housed her rival sons, John Hyrcanus II and Aristobulus II. Each half of the twin palaces, which were located to the south of the Pool complex, was built around a paved inner courtyard. (Fig. 5) The reception room and triclinium opened onto each of the courts via distyle in antis.
Alongside each of the twin palaces was a swimming pool surrounded by a garden and fence. Small reception halls appear to have been constructed next to the pools. In the eastern garden, we also exposed a garden-triclinium that was probably open to the sky, the floor of which was once covered by water; the benches were decorated with frescoes.
Apparently at the same time, changes were made in the Pool Complex, indicating a greater sensitivity to the garden areas. A wall separating the swimming pools from the peristyle garden to the north was demolished and replace by a row of columns. West of the pools, a large hall (11 x 6.5m) probably served for receptions.
After Alexandra’s death, during the period from 67-32, a large swimming pool (20 x 12.5) was added to the east of the twin palaces. At the same time, installations for bathing and ritual immersion were built over the small garden west of the Pool complex. Three long, narrow storerooms, probably for the storage of produce from the larger royal estate, were erected in the corresponding small garden to the east of the pools. (Fig. 6)

Keywords  arbors archaeological garden axial plan loam villae rusticae  Garden Description At this site in Hertfordshire near the town of Verulamium (St. Albans) excavations have revealed a multi-phased Roman farm, characterized in late Iron Age and Roman times by an outer courtyard with various service buildings and an inner courtyard in which the farm house stood (Fig. 1).
An avenue 20 meters wide led axially from the gate at the eastern end of the inner courtyard a cross to the front of the house (H in Fig. 1). On either side of the avenue was a line of circular pits spaced 4-6 meters apart (A in Fig. 1). These were filled with fine, homogeneous loam and have been interpreted as planting holes for trees or shrubs. Alternatively, the rows of holes have been interpreted as the postholes of a covered walkway or arbour leading to the house, supporting climbing plants. This feature of the courtyard is contemporary with the first masonry house built around A.D. 100, and represents an attempt to design the compound fronting the house in a more formal way. After 175 the avenue leading to the rebuilt house seems not to have been flanked by trees or an arbour, and numerous trackways leading into both courtyards from the north and south suggest that the entrance to the main residence was no longer strictly axial.

Although the site was not completely excavated, there is evidence to suggest that the main residence (A in Fig. 1) was located at the southern end of the complex, separated from various workshops and subsidiary buildings in the northern half by an area of cultivated soil. This area has been interpreted as a garden, based on the absence of buildings and the presence of 10-15 centimeters thick layer of rich humus (G in Fig. 1). The complex was built between A.D. 280 and 300, with occupation ending around 380.

Keywords  archaeological garden ditches fences (site elements) kitchen gardens orchards paddock rural villas villae rusticae  Garden Description This Roman villa in Gloucestershire is situated about 14 miles west of the civitas capital Corinium Dobunnorum (Cirencester). The main residence is of the winged corridor type, fronted by a large courtyard which was bounded by the house on one side, by a wall on the two sides perpendicular to the house and by a fence on the fourth side opposite the house (Fig. 1). The yard measured 56 x 53 meters.
Excavated evidence indicates that this courtyard was designed as a formal garden in the early 4th century. The courtyard was bisected by a central drive 5 meters wide consisting of rubble with a layer of heavy metalling on top and bounded by kerb stones (P in Fig. 1). It led from the courtyard gate at the southeast and continued to the front of the house. The garden consisted of two planting beds near the house, a hedge and two long beds on either side of the drive (dark grey in Fig. 1) (Fig. 2). These beds had been dug into the stone and gravel and then filled with 20 centimeters of very dark soil. It is not known what plants grew here, although carbonized remains of box plants at the villa may reflect one type of greenery planted in the courtyard. The northeast part of the yard was paved with stone and gravel (dotted in Fig. 1), the southwest part, however, was not paved, suggesting that this part of the garden might have been used as an orchard or an area for trees or shrubs (O in Fig. 1). The formal garden was destroyed by 5th century cultivation. Northwest of the house, i.e. at the back, various ditches marked off a number of areas interpreted as possible paddocks and an area covered with a layer of very dark soil which has been interpreted as a kitchen garden.

Garden Roman Palace in Fishbourne
Keywords  archaeological garden basins (vessels) colonnades loam palaces piscinae presence chambers terrace gardens vegetable gardens  Garden Description Fishbourne Roman Palace was accidentally discovered during the digging of a water main trench in 1960. The discovery led to nine seasons of excavations (1961-69) that showed the site had developed from a military base at the time of the Roman invasion in AD 43 to a sumptuous palace by the end of the first century CE. Carefully excavated by Barry Cunliffe, using techniques of environmental archaeology, the garden excavations at the palace have long served as a model in the development of Roman garden archaeology, although the findings did not initially prompt the investigation of other gardens in Britain. Today the site has been developed for display and education.
The palace contains gardens within its internal courtyards, as well in a larger area to the south, where terraces and other landscape architectural features lay between the residence and the deep water channel (Fig 1.). The main garden of the palace is located in the large central courtyard, and dates to the late 1st century CE. Only the northern half has been excavated, while the remainder lies beneath the gardens of adjacent houses. The garden is bisected by a wide path leading between the entrance to the villa and a large audience hall. Lining the path, bedding trenches in alternating rectangular and semi-circular patterns survived as patterns of dark gray loam against an ochre-colored clay and gravel subsoil. Similar cuttings were found along the colonnades.
Pollen samples were taken in the garden areas in the hope that traces of pollen had survived from flowers and shrubs that had grown in the garden. Unfortunately, only a small quantity of pollen from weeds of cultivation, such as plantain and daisy, remained. As no positive archaeobotanical evidence for specific plants survived on site, literary sources were used to select plants that would have survived in the conditions of this northern province. Pliny the Younger refers to clipped box lining the edges of the pathways in the gardens of his Tuscan estate. This lime-loving shrub would have been very appropriate in the deliberately marled loam of these trenches, so, in 1968, it was planted and has thrived. Figure 2 shows the excavated trenches, and figure 3 shows the replanted box.
On the eastern side of the formal garden, alternating tree-pits and post holes were found. The pattern suggested an original arrangement of trees or shrubs planted against a trellis. Again, Pliny the Younger mentions espaliered apples in his gardens, and these have been successfully established at Fishbourne. Less successful was the effort to establish Italian cypress in the location of a large tree-pit found towards the western side of the garden.
Beneath the surface of the garden, the excavators discovered lines of ceramic pipes. They ran from the remains of the base of what is assumed to have been a water storage tank in the northwest corner of the formal garden. One line of pipes probably fed a pool in the entrance hall while others supplied small semi-circular basins set in recesses in the box hedging. Half a marble basin was found in the 1960&amp;rsquo;s.
There is circumstantial evidence for there having been a vegetable garden in the angle between the ends of the north and west wings of the palace where there is a dark, humus-rich soil containing heavily abraded pottery, suggesting that the soil had been intensively cultivated. It also had its own water supply, provided through wooden pipes with iron collars.
Limited excavations to the south of the palace revealed an artificial terrace which bore evidence of landscaping, including a pool, a gravel path, possible bedding trenches and what may have been the base for a column or statue. Excavations to the east of the palace in the mid 1980&amp;rsquo;s uncovered evidence for semi-formal gardens.

This courtyard, approximately 10 x 13 m. in size, was almost certainly a garden (Plan 1, G). A ground level gutter ran around the edge of the unpaved courtyard. This part of the house remained unchanged until the destruction of the building in the 4th century.

Garden House of Dionysius (Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium)
Keywords  urban villas villae urbanae triclinia insulae peristyles (Roman courtyards) apsed pools axial plan piscinae  Garden Description The largest urban villa excavated thus far in Cologne is the House of Dionysos (3400 sq. m.), named after the early 3rd century mosaic floor decorated with Dionysiac motifs in the triclinium (Image 1??). The house occupies part of an insula in the northeastern corner of the city, bordered on the south by a street leading to the harbor.
The original house, erected after A.D. 50, was rebuilt under Vespasian and included a peristyle garden courtyard measuring 23 x 27 m. (G on Plan 1). The garden was surrounded on three sides by a peristyle, 3.35 m. in width. A ground level gutter ran around the edge of the garden. At this time, a masonry pool with a paved floor occupied a position in the eastern part of the garden. A piece of lead pipe and a bronze opening were found associated with the pool. This was later replaced in the second half of the 2nd century by an apsed pool (4.20 x 5.40 m.) in the western half of the garden which drained into the gutter at the west. The pool was axially arranged between the entrance to the house on the east and the dining room on the west, from which a view through a wide doorway onto the garden was afforded. The triclinium was unheated, leading the excavator to interpret it as a summer triclinium. The connection with the garden would, in this case, be quite understandable. An axial planting pattern in the garden with a path leading from the entrance of the house to the pool is possible. There is, however, no evidence for the planting pattern or the type of vegetation in this garden. The house was inhabited until the 4th century.

Keywords  archaeological garden ditches drains horticultural containers piscinae rural villas villae rusticae water baths  Garden Description This country estate in modern Kent possessed a large ornamental pool (P in Fig. 1) in the area in front of the main residence (A in Fig. 1) and to the east of the attached bath house (Fig. 1). The masonry pool measuring 25 x 3.50 meters lay parallel to the house frontage. From the pool ran a masonry drain. Although no traces of bedding trenches or plantings have been detected in the yard around the pool, it might be assumed that the pool was a centerpiece of a garden (G in Fig. 1). Interestingly, in the backfill of a ditch under the southeast wing of the villa at least thirty planting pots were retrieved in excavations. The vessels had three knife-cut triangular holes in the lower body and a round hole through the base (Fig. 2, nest page). The pots were misfired and almost certainly manufactured in kilns near the villa in the decade after A.D. 50. Although the planting pots were not found in context in pits within a garden, it is clear that they were being produced locally for use at Eccles or other gardens nearby. Excavations have established that the estate was continually occupied from the middle of the 1st century until the 4th century. In its final 4th century form, the villa complex measured 89 x 116 meters, including its wings and the courtyard.

Tarraconensis(Pleiades)
Province Description In 236 BC, to offset Carthage&amp;rsquo;s loss of Sicily and Sardinia in the First Punic War, Hamilcar Barca led an expedition into Hispania to establish a colony there. Through force of arms and diplomacy, he spread Carthaginian influence as far north as Barcellona, which bears his name. In 230 BC, Hasdrubal, his son-in-law, established Qart Hadast that became Carthago Nova in Roman times and Cartagena today. After the death of Hasdrubal, Hannibal, Hamilcar&amp;rsquo;s oldest son, took command, attacked Saguntum, and in 218 set out for Italy leaving his younger brother, Hasdrubal, in command in Spain. Through the Alps, he descended into Italy and threatened Rome for fourteen years. Roman armies under the brothers Gnaeus and Publius Cornelius Scipio kept Hasdrubal in check and prevented his reinforcing Hannibal. They were both killed by the Carthaginians in 212. Two years later, another Publius Cornelius Scipio, the 25-year-old son of the late general of the same name, was sent to Spain. The next year, he captured New Carthage and, in 206 at the battle of Ilipa (about 15 km north of Savilla) destroyed most of the Carthaginians&amp;rsquo; numerically superior army and ended their hold on Spain. Scipio settled his wounded veterans nearby at a place he called Italica to remind them of their origins. Today, it is one of the best Roman archaeological sites in Italy. After a quick trip back to Rome, where he was elected consul, he returned to Spain and went on to attack Carthage itself. Hannibal was recalled to Africa, but Scipio annihilated his army in 202. Rome thus came into possession of the Mediterranean coast of Iberia.
If Rome was drawn into Hispania to keep the Carthaginians there from supporting Hannibal in Italy, it missed the opportunity offered by Hannibal&amp;rsquo;s defeat to get out of Spain honorably. Instead, in 197 BC it created two new Roman provinces, Hispania Citerior whose capital was Carthago Nova and Hispania Ulterior with Corduba as its capital. Soon after, Rome launched a long war to subjugate the Lusitani, Celtiberians on the west coast. During Sulla&amp;rsquo;s dictatorship, the Lusitani were again in revolt, this time under the able leadership of the Roman general Quintus Sertorius, who sought to create an independent, Roman-like state in Hispania. He established a senate and schools for the sons of the local nobility.
Augustus&amp;rsquo;s conquest of Hispania produced a new territorial division that replaced the earlier two-province organization of the region. Augustus divided the whole of the peninsula into three provinces: Hispania Citerior or Tarraconensis, with its capital Tarraco (Tarragona); Hispania Ulterior Baetica, with its capital Corduba (Córdoba); and Hispania Ulterior Lusitania, or Emerita Augusta, with its capital Mérida. The provinces, in turn, were subdivided in administrative legal units, or conventus. The western lands stayed part of the newly demarcated Lusitania, areas into which Romanization had hardly penetrated, in contrast to the other areas of the peninsula where the classical tradition had been incorporated quite early. This division lasted until late antiquity, when Tarraconensis was subdivided into three provinces: Tarraconensis, whose capital continued to be Tarraco (Tarragona), Carthaginiensis, with Carthago Nova (Catagena) as its capital, and Gallaecia, whose capital was Bracara Augusta (Braga, in northern Portugal).
The Mediterranean trio of wine, oil and cereals are the crops most frequently mentioned by all the classical authors when referring to the Iberian Peninsula. These were not the only plants cultivated here. Trogus Pompey, in his Universal History (44. 1-2), praises, as well as those products, the fertility of the soil itself, the benevolence of its climate, the opportune and abundant rains which enable all types of fruits to be gathered, thus supplying every need. He describes the linen and esparto grass as of the highest quality. Strabo recorded the tradition of irrigation as a common practice in pre-Roman agriculture (Strabo 3.2.5). This was continued by the Romans, as shown by the number of aqueducts, dams and small reservoirs still to be found on Spanish soil. Pliny, during his stay as procurator in Spain in the first century, gives more specific descriptions of the flora throughout his Natural History (Book XVI). Martial (Epigrams II) refers to myrtle, box and laurel, as common elements to be found in the garden of country houses in Spain.
It is not strange, therefore, that gardening, the work of the topiarius, was usual in Iberian houses, as this study shows. It was not, however, totally new to Spanish territory. Although there are no literary references to gardening in the Pre-Roman era, it must have been part of Iberian culture, as is proved in an unusual way in the northwest of the peninsula in the area under the influence of Greek culture from the city of Emporion (Ampurias or Empuriae). A Hellenic establishment there, Rhode (Rosas), in the third century BC minted drachmas with a rose as the emblem. There were sacred woods connected with the cities. Close to Augustas Emeritas was Lucus Feroniae. Dedicated to Augustus was Lucus Augusti, which gave rise to the present-day Lugo, in Galicia, and another Lucus existed in the environs of Gijón, the Lugo de Llanera (Blázquez, p. 24).
There has been little research on the gardens in the Roman settlements in Spain and Portugal. In drawing up the list of sites with gardens for this catalog, we have accepted that a garden existed when it was so labeled by the excavators. There are, however, many other probable gardens which we have included. Gorges found just under forty villas where enough remained to draw a plan. In them, certain features help to identify a garden. A peristyle alerts us to suspect a garden, but peristyle courtyards were sometimes paved with stones or bricks over a layer of lime. They were clearly not gardens. But if the courtyard had soil in it, it was in all probability a garden. Fountains, fountain statues, and pools are typical of a garden since water is indispensable for a garden. Most peristyles in Roman villas in Spain had ornamental irrigation channels, semicircular pools, wells or pools that gave the impression of still water that, nevertheless, endowed the garden with a cool humidity that favored the cultivation of plants. In Spain, peristyles with drainage are found in the first and second centuries AD and are also common in the late Empire. Certain types of statuary intimately connected with vegetation and nature are found in gardens, such as divinities related to Bacchus and his circle. At Pompeii, Diana, a garden goddess, sometimes paired with Apollo, is also found. Herms were placed on pilasters, as the examples in situ from Pompeii show. Characteristic of Roman villas was the way in which they opened out to the countryside onto a grand vista of gardens and parks filled with fountains.
The roughly triangular province of Tarraconensis, by far the largest of the three provinces of the Iberian Peninsula, stretched across the north side of modern Spain and down the east coast as far as Almeria. On the Atlantic coast, it reached as far south as present Oporto.

Garden Rustic villa at Blankenheim-Hülchrath
Keywords  rural villas villae rusticae  Garden Description This villa rustica was built on a slope so that the residential building (A on Plan 1) overlooked the rest of the lower lying farmyard (Image 1). The entire complex covered an area 120 m. in width and 250 m. in length (3 hectares). The house was separated from a large open area behind and to the southwest of it by a wall. This has been interpreted as a utilitarian garden (G on Plan 1), and it may well be that an orchard and a vegetable garden were located here near the house.
To the northeast of the house was an open courtyard flanked by outbuildings and separated from the service area of the farm by a terrace wall. This open courtyard may have been a garden (G on Plan 1), perhaps of a more decorative nature. Without any physical evidence for gardens, however, this remains speculation.

Keywords  peristyles courtyards triclinia  Garden Description The villa was first excavated in 1928-9.(Ampu More than 22 rooms were paved with mosaics for a total area of 1,400 square meters of mosaic. Made of local stones, they date from the second century AD. Among them is a rare picture of a crown of shafts a grain, a symbol of agricultural fertility.
This villa is one of the best examples in Spain of an axially planned peristyle villa. In the center of its grand peristyle courtyard (41 x 22 m.) was a structure which may have been part of a water supply system for the garden in the courtyard. The main reception room (Fig. 1, 1, in the center of the north wing) had a wide opening onto the garden and a passage through the low wall which otherwise surrounded the garden on three sides and half of the fourth. Likewise room [2] on the east side, possibly a triclinium, had a good view of the garden. An unusual feature, however, is that, with the exception of these two rooms, all the other rooms around the porticoes of the peristyle did not open directly onto the portico but onto narrow corridors perpendicular to the portico. Thus, unless they had windows, they did not get light and air directly from the garden courtyard.

Keywords  archaeological garden kitchen gardens piscinae rural villas villae rusticae waterspouts  Garden Description Excavations at this site of a Roman villa in Kent uncovered a large rectangular masonry pool in the courtyard, which was enclosed by buildings on the north, west, and east (Fig. 1). The villa buildings took up an area of 150 x 225 meters in total, including the courtyard with a width of 26.5 meters. Occupation at the site began after A.D. 100 and continued until the closing decades of the 4th century.
This pool (P in Fig. 1), measuring 25.6 x 3.36 meters, lay at right angles to the center of the main residence and bisected an enclosed courtyard, possibly a garden (G in Fig. 1) in front of the house. The pool would have been a decorative element in the courtyard. Within the pool at the end nearest the house was found a small bronze water-spout in the form of the head of a lioness. At the other end was a semi-circular pool with provision for the inflow and outflow of water.
South of the western range of rooms was a large, open space measuring 14.6 x 58.4 meters, enclosed by walls. There was no paving in this area, nor was there any evidence for partitions. It has been suggested that this might have been a kitchen garden (G in Fig. 1).

Keywords  archaeological garden animal bone bathhouses (water recreation structures) drains mosaics (visual works) sherds villae rusticae  Garden Description This Roman villa in Gloucestershire was partially excavated in the late 19th century, but only the built features and their mosaic floors appear to have been of interest to the Victorian diggers. Excavations in the courtyard conducted between 2000 and 2002 revealed that earlier excavators had not disturbed the courtyard.
Parts of the villa may date to the early 3rd century A.D. at the latest, but extensions to existing buildings and the arrangement of the residential wings around an open courtyard can be ascribed to the early 4th century (Fig. 1). The slightly trapezoidal courtyard had a maximum width of 25 meters and a maximum length of 40 meters. The recent excavations in the courtyard show that in the early 4th century soil was brought in and dumped over earlier built features such as drains, transforming the newly created courtyard into a garden (G in Fig. 1). In places, this garden soil was as much as 50 centimeters deep. The dark garden soil containing domestic refuse does not appear to have been reworked regularly for cultivation since the sherds and animal bones in it were not abraded. The courtyard surface may have been lawned rather than planted with flowers, hedges or other vegetation. Excavations have not revealed planting pits or planting beds, but the possibility of randomly spaced trees cannot be ruled out. The courtyard must have been a high-status element of this residential part of the estate, the rooms arranged around the garden having included private dining rooms and baths. In the second half of the 4th century the garden was abandoned and parts of the courtyard roughly paved with flagstones, indicating that the area in its later years possibly functioned as a yard for animals and wheeled traffic or for other utilitarian purposes.

Keywords  archaeological garden bathhouses (water recreation structures) drains gazebos horticultural containers piscinae villae rusticae  Garden Description Excavations between 1983 and 1986 at this site in Buckinghamshire revealed a Roman villa of the winged corridor type, which was built in the late 3rd century and rebuilt and enlarged in the mid-4th century (Fig.1).
From the two projecting wings of the house at the northeast and southeast two walls ran eastward, forming an enclosed courtyard 35.5 meters in width and ca. 42 meters in length in front of the 4th century house. In the centre of the yard was a stone-built rectangular fishpond (P in Fig. 1), 2.6 x 13 meters in size and 50-80 centimeters deep which was continually fed by a drain running from an overflow in the cold plunge bath at the south end of the house. An overflow at the east end of the pool may have led to a nearby stream. Although traces of plantings or planting beds were not preserved in the gravelly subsoil, a shallow rectangular depression just west of the fishpool, filled with dark humic soil, may represent a flowerbed through which the water pipe feeding the pool ran. The courtyard therefore was at least partially planted as a garden (G in Fig. 1). Adjacent to the courtyard enclosure at the south was an octagonal structure with stone walls, interpreted as a possible gazebo (A in Fig. 1).
The villa complex that preceded the winged corridor house is also of interest in regard to gardens. The earlier aisled house of late 1st to late 2nd century date was part of a series of buildings and enclosures that included a walled area to the northeast measuring 27 x 18.3 meters in size. Inside this enclosure was a deposit of dark humic soil between 4 and 6 centimeters deep. Environmental analysis of soil samples from the enclosure suggests that the area was used as a kitchen garden with plants such as brassicas, celery, mustard, coriander, summer savory and caper spurge. Three ceramic vessels with at least one hole pierced through the side or the base, possibly planting pots, may have been associated with this phase of the villa garden.

      <description>Province Britannia
Province Description After Caesar’s campaigns in Britain in 55 and 54 BC, the southern part of the island lay within Rome’s sphere of influence. It was not until the Claudian invasion in 43 AD, however, that Britain was annexed as a Roman province, although the ‘conquest’ of Britain in the west and north continued and proceeded slowly in the decades thereafter. Apart from a brief interlude in the mid-2nd century, when the northern border of the province was fixed at the Antonine Wall in Scotland, from the 120&amp;rsquo;s the northern frontier of the island lay on Hadrian’s Wall stretching from the west to the east coast. The provincial capital was Londinium (London) on the Thames River.
Britain is geographically and geologically diverse, and it was characterized in the Roman period by a variety of confined ecosystems. Even before the conquest, grain, cattle, and metals, were exported to the continent. Cereal production, chiefly spelt wheat and barley, were the mainstay of the Roman agrarian economy of the province. In the 3rd and 4th centuries, Britain was a prosperous and secure place, little threatened by the barbarian incursions disrupting life across the channel in Gaul and Germany. In 359/360, shipments of sorely needed British grain were procured to supply the harassed army and civilians on the Rhine. By the late Roman period, British woollen textiles also were valued exports. Under Septimius Severus (193-211), the island was split into two provinces: Britannia Superior and Britannia Inferior. During the reign of Diocletian (284-305), the two British provinces were further divided into four: Britannia Prima, Maxima Caesariensis, Britannia Secunda and Flavia Caesariensis. The capitals of these provinces were Corinium (Cirencester), Londinum (London), Eboracum (York) and Lindum (Lincoln) respectively.

Province Description Location Camulodunum
Camulodunum (Pleiades)
Location Description Camulodunum began as an Iron Age settlement defended by dykes, a combination of V-shaped ditch and rampart created by the upcast earth. It extended from the Roman river on the south to the Colne on the north, a distance of some four kilometers. Within this larger area, a legionary fort was built after the Claudian conquest of Britain in AD 43. On the site of the fort, a veteran colony was planted in about AD 49 and given the name Colonia Victricensis, City of Victory. It became the first provincial capital, later superseded by Londinium (London). Outside its walls was a V-shaped defensive ditch.
Garden Suburban Gardens in Camulodunum
Keywords  archaeological garden ditches villae suburbanae  Garden Description Outside the walls of the city, utilitarian gardens were planted, possibly in the 3rd century, in allotments along the road leading to the Balkerne Gate. Upon the widening of the defensive ditch at the foot of the walls around AD 275, a thick dump of soil was deposited on these garden allotments, preserving a short stretch of mounded cultivation beds laid out in rows. The excavators have suggested that the beds might have been formed for growing vines or plants such as asparagus. It is uncertain whether the gardens were attached to suburban dwellings at this time, but by about 300 practically all suburban houses in this area had been demolished without replacement.

      <description>Province Syria
Province Description In 64 BCE, after his successes in Armenia, Pompey the Great added Syria to the list of annexed eastern provinces of the growing Roman Empire. The conquest of Syria had not been difficult, because the remnants of the once dominant Seleucid Empire had weakened following the defeats of king Antiochus III at Thermopylae in 191 and Magnesia in Asia shortly after. Ultimately, the Seleucids could not withstand the powers of the Nabatean kingdom to the south, the Hasmonean kingdom to the west, and the new threats of Roman hegemony. With the fall of the Seleucids, Rome inherited the majority of Alexander the Great’s former conquests, and the Syrian desert would become a stage for Roman emperors to settle civil conflicts and win triumphs. Smaller Arab settlements sprang up across the region, re-inhabiting Seleucid sites and establishing new ones, and cities such as Palmyra grew in power by taking over the wealthy trade routes of the Nabateans in the second century CE. The Syrian city of Antioch, formerly Seleucia, would become one of the greatest cities of the Roman empire. Although Macedonian presence in the region introduced western styles in art and architecture before the arrival of the Romans, the cities remained Syrian in culture, population and character.
Covering the substantial central part of the Fertile Crescent, the province of Syria sat in an advantageous position between the mountain ranges of eastern Anatolia, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Arabian deserts, and it served as an area of expansion for the larger kingdoms around it. Important trans-Asian trade routes made Syria a key component in the Roman imperial economy, and large navigable rivers, such as the Euphrates and the Orontes, were exploited to connect the Persian Gulf with northern cities. The climate, although arid in the inland mountainous areas, was quite conducive to cultivation. River valleys in the mountain chains skirting the coast provided fertile terrain for agriculture, and the Orontes and Euphrates created well-watered plateaus in the steppe and desert regions of the southeast.
An irrigation system based around the qanat, an underground water channel, was used in Syria during the Roman period to water fields and gardens. Although qanats were likely introduced to the region via the earlier Achaemenid Persian dynasty, it was during the Roman and Byzantine periods that irrigation technology improved, and the majority of known qanats date to this time. The water could flow from these channels into canals, small reservoirs known today as birkas, or large wells. The ancient field systems of Syria have been well studied in areas such as the Hauran, a basalt region in the south. Cereals, olives and grapes were important crops, and were cultivated in either the broad fields on the lowland plains, or long, segmented plots on terraces in the rocky highlands. These terraced plots would have held fruit trees or vineyards.
Location Jebel Khalid
Jebel Khalid (Pleiades)
Location Description A colonial military settlement of Macedonian Greeks on the west bank of the Euphrates in North Syria, established in the wake of Alexander the Great&amp;rsquo;s conquests at a control point on the great river highway of the Euphrates (fig.1: location map of Jebel Khalid; fig. 2: aerial view of Jebel Khalid.) By the time the Jebel Khalid palace was constructed in the course of the third century BCE, these resettled Macedonians had been occupying for half a century not only the royal palaces of the Achaemenids, the powerful fifth and fourth century Persian dynasty, but also the palaces of their satraps, the local governors, and we know from literary testimony that both the royal and local palaces boasted paradeisoi, gardens for pleasure and relaxation. It is therefore reasonable that their Greek successors and replacements adopted in the third century what they found to be one of the agreeable and relaxing amenities enjoyed by their fourth-century Persian predecessors. And from here the concept passed to the Greek builders of elaborate villas as exemplified in Greek South Italy of the second century BCE.
While the general settlement of Jebel Khalid appears to have been systematically abandoned at the end of the Seleucid period (late 70s/early 60s BCE), some seasonal occupation continued into the early Roman period in some of the rooms of the Acropolis Palace. The multiplicity of weak floors in some areas suggests occupation by seasonal pastoralists, and Roman–period coins dating from the third century CE onwards occur in areas of stone-robbing. When major elements of the building eventually collapsed they fell on up to a metre of wind-blown soil – up on the Acropolis high-ground there is not the possibility of alluvial wash-down – implying that the building had stood substantially intact but unroofed for several centuries after its abandonment. The ruins attracted Roman-period scavengers, sightseers and stone robbers, who even scratched graffiti in the plaster of fallen masonry (Clarke: 1992/3).
Garden Acropolis Palace at Jebel Khalid
Keywords  cisterns (plumbing components) colonnades courtyards palaces terrace gardens trenches  Garden Description It is apparent that there was once a large limestone outcrop within the Acropolis at the highest point of the Jebel range, providing panoramic views of the Euphrates valley (figs. 3 and 4: overall plan of the site and ground plan of Acropolis palace). This outcrop was quarried to a rough level terrace, leaving a rocky bluff (and evident quarry face) on the western side, against which a stout retaining wall was built, also serving as the exterior western wall of the building. Nowhere, even in foundation trenches, is there any trace of previous occupation. This building was laid out on a virgin site, or the initial quarrying operations totally cleared away any vestige of any earlier habitation. The coin and stamped amphora handle evidence confirms a third-century BCE construction date.
The building was planned around a square central courtyard, &amp;lsquo;room 26&amp;rsquo; (measurements from central point of column bases are N.17100mm, S.17100mm, E.17800mm, W.17840mm; measurements from the corners of &amp;lsquo;room 26&amp;rsquo; are N.25.3m, S.25.1m, E.26.2m, W.26.0m). The bedrock floor of this courtyard was evidently quarried to drain towards a large cistern in the southeast corner, conveniently located close to a major entertainment room (room 20) with two store-rooms and kitchens (rooms 19 and 21) to either side of it. This cistern is bell-shaped and subsequent excavation has revealed that it was lined with an impermeable plaster; it has a roughly circular mouth, 1.5 meter wide, a depth of 6.6 m, and maximum width of 6.7 m. No well-head was found. While it can be assumed that water from the roofs of the surrounding courtyard rooms was collected, no evidence was found for a drainage system into this cistern, although a settling pond and sluice arrangement has been uncovered by excavation. Indeed, there could have been large pithoi or barrels to collect water from lion-headed waterspouts overhead (fig. 5: example of lion-headed water-spout).
A circular stand was found carved into the bedrock (c. 5 cm deep, 37~38 cm in diameter) by the northern stylobate in the courtyard: it may have served to house a garden pot. (Fig. 6: possible stand for flower pot.) A drain, 4.9 m in length and 14 cm in depth, cut into the bedrock across the colonnade floor on the southwestern side of the courtyard have released any water seeping down from the western rocky outcrop and accumulating beneath room 24. There is another drain with a similar function towards the north end of the western stylobate, which released water into the courtyard across a shallow channel, but it did not continue across the courtyard floor. The courtyard floor itself consisted of a few centimeters of a very hard packed mixture of clay and gritty limestone over bedrock, creating a particularly hard surface. The floor of the colonnade was similarly constituted. As flagstones have manifestly been robbed elsewhere in the building, it is possible that the whole area was once paved over this prepared surface.
A stylobate was laid on the four sides of this courtyard on leveled bedrock using ashlar blocks with neatly drafted edges (av. dimensions: 0.860 m x 0.680 m and 0.210~0.260 m deep, but there is considerable variation) with some rustication visible on the courtyard side below the courtyard floor level (fig. 7 details of stylobate). The colonnade is decastyle, with ten columns to a side, 36 in total. A deep and unusually wide foundation trench was cut in front of the stylobate on the courtyard side—going down in places 0.97 m from paving level and being up to 0.82 m wide (fig. 8: excavated garden bed.) Normally one would expect such a trench to be filled with builders&amp;rsquo; rubble and chippings, but in this case, it was filled with rich brown, nitrogenous soil (not the light grey wind-blown dust that has accumulated over time elsewhere at the site). It seems clear that a formal garden was installed around the inside perimeter of much of the courtyard, easily watered from the roof-water collection. Soil samples were taken but have yet to be analysed: there is no other sign of courtyard planting. As such, it constitutes the earliest recorded courtyard garden in a Greek building and it helps to explain the sudden appearance of such plantings in the courtyards of southern Italian houses such as at Pompeii in the second century BCE.

Location Delos
Delos (Pleiades)
Location Description Delos is a small island in the center of the Cyclades measuring about five kilometers north-south and 1.3 kilometers east-west at the widest. In antiquity, it was famous as the birthplace of Apollo. Apollo’s sanctuary, founded in the seventh century B.C., is situated on a small plain next to the main port. It became a principal Panhellenic cult center and always formed the heart of the later settlement and city. The city was under Athenian supremacy in the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. and became independent only in 314 B.C. Although extensive public building occurred during the period of its status as an independent city-state and the island began to develop as a commercial center, the city remained relatively small and was still mainly engaged in local and regional trade with the surrounding Cycladic islands. This changed significantly when the Romans handed control of Delos to Athens in 167 B.C. and declared it a free port. It soon developed into a booming cosmopolitan trade center with merchants coming from all over the Mediterranean world. As a consequence the city grew considerably, mostly to meet the needs of its new purpose. Squares, quays, warehouses, shops, new residential quarters, and clubhouses of foreign associations were constructed, and public buildings and sanctuaries were either renovated and extended or newly built. Although Delos was sacked twice, in 88 B.C. by the troops of Mithridates and 69 B.C. by the pirates under Athenodoros, its desertion during the first century B.C. is predominantly due to the rivalry of increasingly successful Roman ports like Puteoli and Ostia. Life in Delos did not come to an abrupt halt as evidenced by remains of Roman thermae and several Christian basilicas, but it continued on a much smaller scale.
Garden Agora of the Italians
Keywords  colonnades courtyards exedrae (site elements) niches peristyles (Roman courtyards) porticoes water wells  Garden Description The Agora of the Italians, with a size of some 6,000 square meters, is situated prominently in the center of Delos, between the famous sanctuary of Apollo to the south and the Sacred Lake to the north. The design of the Agora centers on a vast courtyard with four double-storied porticoes enclosing 3,450 square meters of an open unpaved terrain (Figs. 1-4). The colonnades are surrounded by the following rooms: (a) a series of three large exedrae (15, 30, 42) and four small exedrae (10, 23, 46, 98), which were all accessible by large thresholds on the ground floor level, with the exception of the raised exedra 98; (b) 27 rectangular (7, 9, 13, 18, 24, 32, 37, 39, 41, 44, 47, 54, 59, 97, 102, 105) and semicircular (16, 25, 30b, 34, 35, 68, 73, 90, 93, 95, 100) statue niches on all sides, which were not accessible, as their openings were closed by doors or grills and the thresholds of many were raised far above the ground floor level; (c) a bath suite with two round sweat baths in the north-west (27-31); (d) a group of three rooms in the west (20-22); and (e) two latrines to the west (5) and east (64). Access to the building is provided by a Doric propylon to the west (3) and two narrow side entrances to the west (2) and the east (70). Two rows of shops bordering the east and south porticoes as well as a row of shops on the northwestern corner of the building do not open to the interior of the Agora, but face the surrounding streets.
The building was erected on the former site of the so-called Sacred Lake, a huge swamp varying over time in size and water level. On the arid island of Delos, this was one of the most humid and fertile places. While the building site for the Agora was drained and stabilized with huge deposits of debris, the Sacred Lake was canalized with an exterior wall, thereby attaining its present form. The Agora itself was neither planned nor constructed in its present form, but is the result of a long building process with about five phases. The original building (Fig. 4) comprised only the large courtyard with double-storied porticoes, the three large lavish Ionic exedrae (15, 30, 42) in the west and north, the propylon (3) and the secondary entrance (2) in the west, and – as a result of the use of earlier walls – some rooms in the west (1, 18/20, 21, 28). The rows of the southern and eastern shops formed part of the original plan, but were only added subsequently in a second phase. In contrast to these, the small exedrae (10, 23, 46, 98), the statue niches, and the bath suite did not belong to the first plan, but were added in a third and fourth phase as a kind of makeshift arrangement and as a reaction to changing needs. In a fifth phase the northwestern shops were gained at the expense of public land.
The Agora of the Italians was most probably constructed between 130-120 B.C., partly destroyed during the raids of 88 B.C., then repaired, and finally abandoned after 69 B.C. Its function is contested, with identifications ranging from a multifunctional commercial meeting place for the Romans and Italians, a slave market, a commercial agora or macellum, a combined palaestra-gladiatorial arena-bath complex to, most recently, a garden-porticus, i.e., a luxurious park-like meeting place with a garden, porticoes, and exedrae.
The exploration of the vast courtyard during the early excavations between 1877 and 1905 was considered disappointing because very few objects were found. Large parts of the courtyard seem to have been dug up, but remains of plants, shrubs or trees were not recorded because they were probably not recognized or of sufficient interest. To this day, the courtyard is often overgrown with plants, flowers, and small trees. Future specialized investigation of the courtyard might definitely prove the existence of plants, but for the moment the following evidence for a garden can be cited.
The courtyard contained perhaps as many as eight wells, three of which are still visible today and five of which were tentatively identified in recent geophysical examinations. The area of the former swamp was still sufficiently humid and could have supplied the necessary water for plants. Although many Hellenistic squares and agorai were not paved, the lack of a pavement is remarkable within the context of Delos. In the last third of the second century B.C. all heavily frequented squares, streets, and quays, which were especially used for commerce and trade, were fully paved with large gneiss slabs. Since the Italians spared no expenses in constructing their first agora or in embellishing it later on, the unpaved floor of the courtyard cannot be due to financial shortcomings, but must have been chosen deliberately to meet a specific purpose. The courtyard lacks a sewer to dispose of waste and especially rain water. The wastewater of the later bath suite (room 27) was not emptied into the sewer of the nearby street, as usual, but was instead drained into the courtyard. Therefore, all available water seems to have been deliberately used to irrigate a garden. Comparisons with other buildings show that the original building of the Agora of the Italians has nothing in common with civic-political agorai, or specific commercial markets, or palaestrae, but resembles much larger ambulatory garden-peristyles of Hellenistic palaces (e.g. Aigai, Pella, Jericho) and Late Republican houses in the Vesuvian area or the lavish garden-porticus in Rome such as the Porticus Pompei and the Porticus Liviae. Like these, the Agora of the Italians was most probably conceived and used as a public park for all kinds of agreeable meetings and sojourns.
The porticoes, and maybe even the courtyard, were decorated with statues. Most of the nearly 240 sculptural fragments found within the confines and in the immediate neighborhood of the Agora seem to come from honorary statues, which were mostly presented in the rectangular and semicircular statue niches, but also outside of them, probably in the porticoes. However, some fragments belonged to historical-political monuments (e.g., at least two or even as many as six statues of Celts) and to decorative sculpture suited for a garden (e.g., Dionysos, Satyr/Apollo/Pothos, herms). These statues could have been placed either in the porticoes or in the courtyard.
Finally, numerous Greek, Latin, and bilingual inscriptions attest that the Agora of the Italians was never referred to as an agora, but probably as a pastas italike (as restored in Roussel and Launey, Inscriptions de Délos, no. 2612). The Latin translation of this could have been porticus Italica or porticus Italicorum which would have more appropriate for a luxurious garden-portico, rather than the agora or forum.

Province Description Ancient Roman colony (founded 118 BCE) and senatorial province located in modern southern France, along the Mediterranean. This province had stronger cultural and political ties to Italy than the rest of Gaul.
Location Toulouse
Toulouse (Pleiades)
Location Description Toulouse was one of the pilgrimage sites on route to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela; French pilgrimage routes to Compostela tend to follow old Roman roads, many of which continued to be utilized as primary roads of communication during the Middle Ages. It is a prehistoric route, taken over by Romans in 106 BCE and then captured by Clovis in 508. Toulouse resisted the crusade against the &amp;ldquo;Albigensian heresy&amp;rdquo; in the early 13th century. It received parlement 1443 and was a witness to the Protestant massacre of 1562 and the scene of the British victory over the French in 1814. Between 1942 and 1944 it was occupied by Nazi rule. There are a number of noteworthy art museum here.Sublocation Domus under the Hôtel d’Assézat
House Domus under the Hôtel d’Assézat
Keywords  domus mosaics (visual works) courtyards peristyles (Roman courtyards) porticoes  House Description The Hôtel d’Assézat is a Renaissance palace which now houses the art collection of Georges Bemberg. In the heart of Toulouse, it is about 150 meters east of the Pont Neuf, in rue de Metz. After original finds in 1979, further vestiges of a domus came to light during salvage excavations in 1993-1994 in connection with expansion of facilities. After a first phase dating from A.D. 1 – 15, of which remain some painted plaster found in the trenches, there developed in the reign of Tiberius, between 15 and 30, a residence with rooms ornamented with carefully executed mosaics. They were organized around a courtyard for household work, as indicated by a fireplace and a sinkhole for waste water. The surface was tamped earth repaired three times – to judge from the surviving strips – with a new layer of clay. In a new phase, the house was completely remodeled with larger rooms sometime between 40 and 80. It took on a more coherent plan: the open space was transformed into a peristyle with a central garden. It was bordered on the three known sides with porticoes; strangely, no trace of the colonnade of the portico has been found. A shallow, U-shaped pool, of which the long arm on the south was at least 17 meters, runs along three of the sides. The garden side of the frame of the pool, the inside of the U, was marked off rhythmically by a little apse on the west side (the bottom of the U) and a rectangular notch on the northern arm, presumably matched by one on the south, though the poor condition of the remains makes any interpretation risky. The central part of the U remained free of any construction and is considered the garden. The bottom of the 90- centimeter-wide channels that formed the pool was hydraulic cement. Since they were 50 centimeters below the floor of the porticoes, these channels must have served to catch rain water as well as to embellish the garden. In a later phase, the bottom of the channels was covered with marble flagstones, which left their imprint in the mortar. The domus must have continued to exist beyond the first century, but no precise evidence of change has been detected before the great modifications of the holding which came in the fifth century.

      <description>Province Africa Proconsularis (province)(Pleiades)
Province Description The history of Roman Africa begins in 146 BC with the destruction of Carthage and the establishment of the province of Africa in the most fertile part of the Carthaginian Empire. The new province covered about 5000 square miles (17,172 square kilometers) of the northern part of modern Tunisia. A praetor governed the area from his headquarters at Utica. The Romans inherited a thriving agriculture developed by the Carthaginians. The climate was hospitable. Wheat and barley were the most important cereals; wine and olive oil were also produced and there were various fruit trees.
Location [THUBURBO MAIUS (Henchir Kasbat), Tunisia (Pleiades)
Location Description The city occupies the slopes of a hill in a fertile grain producing area about 50 kilometers to the south of Tunis. Originally a settlement of mercenary soldiers after the fall of Carthage, it was raised to amunicipium by Hadrian (117-138), and to a colony during therein of Commodus (177-192). The chief public buildings and the most beautiful homes date from this period. After the crisis of the Empire during the third century, Thuburbo saw a rebirth in the fourth century; but as imperial authority declined the city became a mere village.
Garden East Temple (Temple de l&amp;rsquo;Est)
Keywords  [temple] mosaic [root cavities] [temple garden] [grove] [garden soil]  Garden Description A strip of soil bordered most of the long sides of the temple and the mosaic paving in front of it (Plan view, Fig. 1). Preliminary excavations in 1990 in a strip 1m wide at the front of the garden, on the left, yielded a row of root cavities approximately 15cm in diameter and 50-70cm apart suggesting a formal planting. The size of the root cavities indicates that trees or large shrubs, perhaps laurels, were planted there. Temple gardens and groves are well known in the ancient world, primarily from literary evidence, but there is little archaeological evidence. For this reason the complete excavation of both strips of soil is extremely important. The soil in the preceding temples should also be excavated.

      <description>Province Lusitania Lusitania (Pleiades)
Province Description Despite the prior existence of urban centers like Metellinum, the capital of Lusitania was a new foundation, the Colonia Augusta Emerita (Mérida), which would also serve as the capital of one of the smaller juridical units (conventus) and would be the scene of flourishing activity in the succeeding centuries, its prosperity lasting until the late Roman and Visigothic era. Subsequently, a series of well-known Roman cities were built in what was then Lusitania but is now partly in Portugal and partly in Spain. As well as the capital, there were Conimbriga, Salmantica, Evora, Olisipo (now Lisbon), Pax Iulia (now Beja), and Metallium Viscascense (Aljustrel), this last recognized as the capital of an important mining area. The series of wealthy villae, such as that of La Cocosa, Milreu or San Cucufate are particularly noteworthy. Another of the important elements of the Roman era is the series of still visible ways of communication, of which the Vía de la Plata has most remaining, especially in the sections of Baños de Montemayor in Cáceres or the bridges that cross the rivers, such as that of San Pedro de Alcántara, or of Mérida.

Garden House of Bacchus and Ariadne (Maison de Bacchus et Ariane)
Keywords  insula peristyle (Roman courtyards) portico mosaic triclinium basins [root cavities] [pipe] [pool] [fountain] [pits] [lapilli]  Garden Description This large house, occupying most of an insula (excavated in l925), dates in its present form from the early fifth century. The SW part of the house was devoted to business, the production of olive oil.
The rooms on the NE side of the residence area were arranged around a peristyle garden. The mosaic of Bacchus and Ariadne in the large room opening off of the NW portico gave the house its name. The bottom of the semicircular basin projecting into the garden opposite this room was decorated with a wavy water motif; the interior was decorated with plants and imitation marble. This part of the house would have been used by the family and the rooms on the SW for more personal purposes (Plan view, Fig.1). Preliminary excavations in this garden revealed a row of cavities along the southern edge of the garden. Roots arranged in a straight row suggest a produce garden.
The courtyard garden, opposite the handsome triclinium, was located three steps below the triclinium. The triclinium had a view on the garden, impressively framed by two columns. The location of a garden opposite an important room is typical in houses of the African provinces. The semicircular mosaic pool (2.20 m in diameter, 1.10 m deep), which projected into the garden, was decorated on the bottom with the head of Oceanus. A pipe indicated where a fountain had jetted from his mouth.
When the 25-30 cm of soil that had accumulated through the centuries, probably transplanted by the wind, was removed in 1990, evidence of the plantings at the last occupation level was perfectly preserved. The soil that formed when the roots decayed was of an entirely different texture and color from that of the surrounding soil (Fig. 2), making the shape of the ancient roots at ground level as distinct as those of lapilli-filled cavities in the Vesuvian area. There were six large tree-root cavities, the largest dimension at ground level 30-50 cm in diameter, three smaller tree root cavities 18-20 cm in diameter, and many smaller cavities most of which were 5-10 cm in diameter (Fig. 3). Three large rectangular areas, approximately the same size (36 x 72 cm, 40 x 60 cm and 46 x 63 cm) and only a few cm deep, represented decayed wood, the two in the rear garden were probably the wooden bases of a garden bench or table. The one in the back of the mosaic fountain in full view of the triclinium perhaps supported a small table (Fig. 4-5).
Numerous olive pits and bones that showed evidence of burning were found in an area (ca 32 x 45 cm) near the rear of the garden, some on the surface, some shallowly buried. Nearby, in a place where there had been frequent fires, were more shallowly buried bones. Of the 34 bones found, five were those of pig (Sus scrofa L), eight were of sheep (Ovis aries L.) or domestic goat (Capra hirca L.), one was from a rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus L.), and one from a carnivore (cf. Felis catus L.), probably a pet cat. The other bones were too badly broken to be identifiable. An apricot pit was found near the large tree-root cavity in the south corner of the garden.
The location of the cooking area behind the bench or table is logical. Homes at Thuburbo had no kitchens, and cooking was done in the garden. Servants would have cooked the food at the rear of the garden, using the table or bench (which was screened by plantings) for both supplies and cooking food, preparatory to serving guests in the formal triclinium. At other times, during the hot summer the family, and perhaps a few special guests, enjoyed meals in the garden. When the accumulated bones became a problem, they were raked into the fire, and those not burned were shallowly buried, as was the common Roman practice.
The gardens in Tunisia were not preserved at an exact moment in history, as were those in the Vesuvian area. The trees and shrubs in Tunisian gardens would have continued to grow for some time after the site was abandoned. What was uncovered in 1990 was not the garden at its prime. Some of the smaller roots may have been those of seedlings that grew from unpicked fruit that fell from the trees.
The trees in this garden were probably food bearing trees. Ancient Tunisia had few other trees. They knew the palm, pine and cypress, but these trees would have been overpowering in such a small garden. The two large tree-root cavities (on the right in Fig. 3) are the proper size and shape for olive trees. The middle tree on the left was perhaps a fig tree; the tree in the south corner of the garden may have been an apricot. The smaller trees were probably fruit or nut trees. The ancient Tunisians knew the quince, pomegranate, plum, citron, peach, apple, pear and grape – all pictured in the mosaics. There may also have been a few grapes raised for table use in this garden.
We next consider the identity of the many smaller roots. Since this garden was viewed from the large formal dining room, an effort would have been made to make it beautiful all year round. Fruit trees would have been beautiful in flower or fruit but they are deciduous. Only the olive tree is evergreen. Ornamental plant material in ancient Roman gardens was extremely limited, but the majority of the plants were evergreen and produced beautiful gardens in every season, welcome in winter and refreshingly cool in summer. The plant material in Tunisia was limited for the most part to the laurel, myrtle, rosemary, laurustinus, oleander, acanthus and ivy. There does not seem to be a place in this garden for ivy, but any of the other plants could have been used. Roman gardens had few flowers, especially with color. Roses are pictured in Tunisian mosaics and they may have been used in this garden. The oleander (Nerium oleander L.) with its striking pink flowers is the only colorful garden shrub. It is widespread in all Tunisia and tolerant of variable growing conditions. It seems probable that oleanders, so prominent in modern Tunisian gardens, as well as in the wild, also added color to this garden.

Location Description Annexed in 46 B.C., the Romanization of the city of Thugga that was probably a residence of the Numidian kings, was gradual but profound. It became Municipium Thuggense in 205, and was raised to the rank of a Colonia Licinia Septima Aurelia Alexandriana Thuggensesin in 261 under Gallien. Numerous buildings of this city overlooking the valley of the Ouadi Khaled, have been uncovered among them the Capitol dedicated to the Capitoline Triad in 166-67, the theater on the top of the plateau constructed under Antonius Pius, the Temple of Mercury, Fortune, Augustan Piety, Liber Pater, Concordia, Frugifer, Pluto, Saturn and the Temple of Caelestis which stands in the middle of a an olive grove. In the residential areas stands the Licinian Baths with their Palestrae and the Cyclops Baths and the Triumphal Arch of Septimus Severus set astride a street leading down the hill. Two building inscriptions (CIL VIII, 26606 and CIL VIII, 26607), dated to AD 166-169 mention a theater with a basilica, porticoes, and xystis.

Location Conimbriga
Conimbriga (Pleiades)
Location Description The pre-Roman oppidum of Conimbriga was made the capital of a civitas in the Augustan period and, thereafter, a forum, a public bath-house, an aqueduct and city walls were constructed. During the Flavian period, the city was made a municipium with ius Latii. At the end of the third or beginning of the fourth century AD, new fortification walls considerably reduced the area occupied by the city. In the time of the Suevi it was an Episcopal See, which was then transferred to Aeminium (the present day Coimbra) around A. D. 585, when the kingdom of the Suevi was conquered by the Visigoths. Further reduced in area and impoverished, the city survived until 986, at which date, according to Arab sources, it was destroyed by the great Muslim chief Almansor. In addition to the Augustan forum, which was completely rebuilt on a new ground plan under the Flavians, four bath houses have been excavated, and preliminary trial trenches established the plan of the amphitheater. Four domus have been excavated, three of which were left outside the wall built under the late empire. It is in these houses, all built around peristyles, that we find the gardens of Conimbriga.
Garden House of the Cantaber
Keywords  statuettes (free-standing sculpture) peristyles (columnades)  Garden Description Hidacio, bishop of Chaves and a chronicler of his age, records that the Suevi sacked Conimbriga in 465 and 468 A.D. and that in the second year “the most noble Cantaber” was killed and his family sold into slavery. This house is by far the finest inside the city walls, so it is reasonably guessed to be that of Cantaber. It is larger than the House of the Fountains with an area of more than 3,300 square meters. The garden is similar, although it is less elaborate, has slightly different proportions, and has no fountains. Although the house underwent structural alterations, the peristyle is part of the original plan, which does not appear to date from much later than the Flavian era.
Originally, a large area at the south end was a garden occupying nearly a third of the area of the house. It was later sacrificed to become baths, so it is tinted slightly green on the plan in Figure 1.
The large dimensions of this house required further open spaces for light and air. Two of these had flower beds, although on a much smaller scale.
South of the central peristyle was a large room that centered on the garden, and on the east side of it a large doorway opened open on a large pool with eight columns around the eastern half of the pool. Along the sides were masonry planters projecting a foot or so into the pool. They must certainly have been filled with earth where plants or flowers must have been grown. The boxes covered in pink mortar are clearly visible in the foreground in Figure 3. Traces of plinths in the spaces between the columns suggest that there may have been small statuettes there.
The other garden area was slightly farther south and against the east wall of the house. A portico ran around three sides but required only three columns, all on the west side. The rectangular pool (6.5 x2.5 m) had three basically square flower beds aligned in it. The two end squares, however, had semicircular niches cut out of the center of each side, while the center square had a circle cut out of its center and connected to the surrounding water. As in the House of the Fountains, flower beds in the pool appeared like islands in a lake (Fig. 4). One can imagine that this secluded spot was a favorite of the most noble Cantaber.

      <description>Province Lusitania Lusitania (Pleiades)
Province Description Despite the prior existence of urban centers like Metellinum, the capital of Lusitania was a new foundation, the Colonia Augusta Emerita (Mérida), which would also serve as the capital of one of the smaller juridical units (conventus) and would be the scene of flourishing activity in the succeeding centuries, its prosperity lasting until the late Roman and Visigothic era. Subsequently, a series of well-known Roman cities were built in what was then Lusitania but is now partly in Portugal and partly in Spain. As well as the capital, there were Conimbriga, Salmantica, Evora, Olisipo (now Lisbon), Pax Iulia (now Beja), and Metallium Viscascense (Aljustrel), this last recognized as the capital of an important mining area. The series of wealthy villae, such as that of La Cocosa, Milreu or San Cucufate are particularly noteworthy. Another of the important elements of the Roman era is the series of still visible ways of communication, of which the Vía de la Plata has most remaining, especially in the sections of Baños de Montemayor in Cáceres or the bridges that cross the rivers, such as that of San Pedro de Alcántara, or of Mérida.
Location Conimbriga
Conimbriga (Pleiades)
Location Description The pre-Roman oppidum of Conimbriga was made the capital of a civitas in the Augustan period and, thereafter, a forum, a public bath-house, an aqueduct and city walls were constructed. During the Flavian period, the city was made a municipium with ius Latii. At the end of the third or beginning of the fourth century AD, new fortification walls considerably reduced the area occupied by the city. In the time of the Suevi it was an Episcopal See, which was then transferred to Aeminium (the present day Coimbra) around A. D. 585, when the kingdom of the Suevi was conquered by the Visigoths. Further reduced in area and impoverished, the city survived until 986, at which date, according to Arab sources, it was destroyed by the great Muslim chief Almansor. In addition to the Augustan forum, which was completely rebuilt on a new ground plan under the Flavians, four bath houses have been excavated, and preliminary trial trenches established the plan of the amphitheater. Four domus have been excavated, three of which were left outside the wall built under the late empire. It is in these houses, all built around peristyles, that we find the gardens of Conimbriga.
Garden House of the Fountains
Keywords  mosaics (visual works) peristyles (columnades)  Garden Description This house is almost entirely excavated, the exception being its north facade, which is still covered by a local lane. It occupies an area of almost 3400 square meters. Its mosaics, published in their entirety, date from the second half of the second century A.D, or the Severan era. The construction of the house dates to between 150 and 175 AD. The house has a central peristyle with twenty-six columns. The area of the large open part (12m x 26m) is completely filled with a pool with a maximum depth of 0.90 meters, inside of which the architect installed six very formal flower-beds. On the edges of these, more than 500 water-jets played continually. The unusual design of this peristyle has its only parallel in the Domus Augustana built in Rome for the emperor Domitian by the architect Rabirius. This parallel, pointed out by L. Cremain 1959 in his L’architettura, has been related by other writers, none of whom has found anything similar in Roman domestic architecture in any part of the Empire.
The house has recently been the subject of a monograph by Isabelle Morand in which she undertakes to recover the geometrical and numerical principles used by the architect and to identify astronomical and astrological allusions in the house.

      <description>Province Africa Proconsularis (Pleiades)
Province Description The history of Roman Africa begins in 146 BC with the destruction of Carthage and the establishment of the province of Africa in the most fertile part of the Carthaginian Empire. The new province covered about 5000 square miles (17,172 square kilometers) of the northern part of modern Tunisia. A praetor governed the area from his headquarters at Utica. The Romans inherited a thriving agriculture developed by the Carthaginians. The climate was hospitable. Wheat and barley were the most important cereals; wine and olive oil were also produced and there were various fruit trees.
Location [THUBURBO MAIUS (Henchir Kasbat), Tunisia (Pleiades)
Location Description The city occupies the slopes of a hill in a fertile grain producing area about 50 kilometers to the south of Tunis. Originally a settlement of mercenary soldiers after the fall of Carthage, it was raised to amunicipium by Hadrian (117-138), and to a colony during therein of Commodus (177-192). The chief public buildings and the most beautiful homes date from this period. After the crisis of the Empire during the third century, Thuburbo saw a rebirth in the fourth century; but as imperial authority declined the city became a mere village.

Keywords  peristyle (Roman courtyards) portico mosaic basins  Garden Description This very large house on the western edge of the site had two sectors, the Trifolium area and the Protome area (Plan view, Fig. 1).
The Trifolium sector, was laid out around a peristyle garden (II-V, I) enclosed on four sides by a portico of 12 columns. The garden, 35 cm lower than the level of the portico, had a deep rectangular pool (1) and a semicircular basin (2, 3) placed at each end of the garden on the axis of the oecus (XI). Eight ceramic vases (8 cm in dia., 30 cm deep) embedded in the sides of the pool provided places for the fish to lay eggs and served as shady retreats for the fish. The pool and the basins were paved with mosaics. These have been mostly destroyed, but pieces of the bottom paving of the basin (3) show birds and a hare among cut branches of flowers.

Garden House of the Skeletons
Keywords  mosaics (visual works) peristyles (Roman courtyards) axial plan  Garden Description The peristyle garden of the fourth domus follows a different pattern. In contrast to the House of the Swastika Mosaic, this house is very squarely centered on the garden. The axis of the entrance bisects the garden and the triclinium on the other side. A shallow rill with a small exedra on this axis winds around the peristyle, leaving a cultivated rectangle in the center. In front of the triclinium there is a square pool, also shallow, lined with slabs of limestone and set into the cultivated area but not joined to the rill.
The large mosaic of the bedroom (Fig. 1, C) was restored in the 1950&amp;rsquo;s; but even originally it was in relatively good condition. Elsewhere in the house, however, there are only a few patches of mosaic owing to the area have been used as a necropolis in the late empire, a use that gave the house the name by which it is now called.
The houses were excavated around 1940, at a time when there was no thought of recovering micro-remains from the soil of the flower-beds, which could have allowed the identification of the vegetal species present in these gardens. There is therefore no evidence as to what was planted. There is also no mention of sculptural elements, which may or may not have been present.

Garden House of the Swastika Mosaic
Keywords  mosaics (visual works)  Garden Description Far more modest than the House of Cantaber but following the same general ideas of garden design, this house was left outside the new city wall built during the late empire. The mosaics, now in excellent condition after modern restoration, can be dated to the mid third century A.D., but the house is the result of several successive transformations. Presumably that history explains why the main room with the mosaic with many swastikas is not aligned with the axis of the garden, though two of its three doorways offered views of it.

Location Arelate
Arelate (Pleiades)
Location Description Arles was one of the pilgrimage sites on route to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. French pilgrimage routes to Compostela tend to follow old Roman roads, many of which continued to be utilized as primary roads of communication during the Middle Ages. Arles was a leading city of the west Roman Empire. It fell under Visigoth control during the 6th century and then under Muslims rule in 730. It has a Roman arena dating to the 1st century BCE, which is presently used for bullfights and plays. It also has many Roman ruins. Arles was home to Vincent van Gogh during a productive period of his career.Sublocation House under the Crédit Agricole

      <description>Province Syria
Province Description In 64 BCE, after his successes in Armenia, Pompey the Great added Syria to the list of annexed eastern provinces of the growing Roman Empire. The conquest of Syria had not been difficult, because the remnants of the once dominant Seleucid Empire had weakened following the defeats of king Antiochus III at Thermopylae in 191 and Magnesia in Asia shortly after. Ultimately, the Seleucids could not withstand the powers of the Nabatean kingdom to the south, the Hasmonean kingdom to the west, and the new threats of Roman hegemony. With the fall of the Seleucids, Rome inherited the majority of Alexander the Great’s former conquests, and the Syrian desert would become a stage for Roman emperors to settle civil conflicts and win triumphs. Smaller Arab settlements sprang up across the region, re-inhabiting Seleucid sites and establishing new ones, and cities such as Palmyra grew in power by taking over the wealthy trade routes of the Nabateans in the second century CE. The Syrian city of Antioch, formerly Seleucia, would become one of the greatest cities of the Roman empire. Although Macedonian presence in the region introduced western styles in art and architecture before the arrival of the Romans, the cities remained Syrian in culture, population and character.
Covering the substantial central part of the Fertile Crescent, the province of Syria sat in an advantageous position between the mountain ranges of eastern Anatolia, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Arabian deserts, and it served as an area of expansion for the larger kingdoms around it. Important trans-Asian trade routes made Syria a key component in the Roman imperial economy, and large navigable rivers, such as the Euphrates and the Orontes, were exploited to connect the Persian Gulf with northern cities. The climate, although arid in the inland mountainous areas, was quite conducive to cultivation. River valleys in the mountain chains skirting the coast provided fertile terrain for agriculture, and the Orontes and Euphrates created well-watered plateaus in the steppe and desert regions of the southeast.
An irrigation system based around the qanat, an underground water channel, was used in Syria during the Roman period to water fields and gardens. Although qanats were likely introduced to the region via the earlier Achaemenid Persian dynasty, it was during the Roman and Byzantine periods that irrigation technology improved, and the majority of known qanats date to this time. The water could flow from these channels into canals, small reservoirs known today as birkas, or large wells. The ancient field systems of Syria have been well studied in areas such as the Hauran, a basalt region in the south. Cereals, olives and grapes were important crops, and were cultivated in either the broad fields on the lowland plains, or long, segmented plots on terraces in the rocky highlands. These terraced plots would have held fruit trees or vineyards.
Location Batnae
Batnae/Markopolis (Pleiades)
Location Description The broad plain of Batanaea lay to the west of the uplands, known as Auranitis, in the Hauran, a basalt region that straddled the boundary between ancient Syria and Arabia. Batanaea was not a naturally well-watered area, but it did develop during the Roman period into a successful grain-producing settlement via a careful management of rainwater. The agriculture of the area, which included small enclosed gardens and plantations surrounding villages, depended on precipitation; a large cistern, or birket, commonly found throughout the Hauran and Batanaea, likely served the village and not irrigation purposes. Although the village was perhaps the most ubiquitous settlement type, there did exist some imperial and private estates, potentially with their own gardens.
Garden Imperial Residence at Batnae
Keywords Garden Description The Emperor Julian described the imperial residence in Batnae in Syria in one of his letters to Libanius in 363 CE (Epist. 58). According to him, Batnae was thickly wooded with groves of cypress trees. The palace located there hardly seemed grand, but its garden was worthy of praise; Julian (Epist. 58) compared it to the gardens of Alcinous and Laertes in Homer’s Odyssey. It contained a small grove of cypresses, as well as rows of such trees planted along the garden wall, and in the middle of the garden were vegetable beds and fruit trees of all sorts.

Location Delos
Delos (Pleiades)
Location Description Delos is a small island in the center of the Cyclades measuring about five kilometers north-south and 1.3 kilometers east-west at the widest. In antiquity, it was famous as the birthplace of Apollo. Apollo’s sanctuary, founded in the seventh century B.C., is situated on a small plain next to the main port. It became a principal Panhellenic cult center and always formed the heart of the later settlement and city. The city was under Athenian supremacy in the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. and became independent only in 314 B.C. Although extensive public building occurred during the period of its status as an independent city-state and the island began to develop as a commercial center, the city remained relatively small and was still mainly engaged in local and regional trade with the surrounding Cycladic islands. This changed significantly when the Romans handed control of Delos to Athens in 167 B.C. and declared it a free port. It soon developed into a booming cosmopolitan trade center with merchants coming from all over the Mediterranean world. As a consequence the city grew considerably, mostly to meet the needs of its new purpose. Squares, quays, warehouses, shops, new residential quarters, and clubhouses of foreign associations were constructed, and public buildings and sanctuaries were either renovated and extended or newly built. Although Delos was sacked twice, in 88 B.C. by the troops of Mithridates and 69 B.C. by the pirates under Athenodoros, its desertion during the first century B.C. is predominantly due to the rivalry of increasingly successful Roman ports like Puteoli and Ostia. Life in Delos did not come to an abrupt halt as evidenced by remains of Roman thermae and several Christian basilicas, but it continued on a much smaller scale.
Garden Kitchen and Commercial Gardens
Keywords inscriptions market gardens
Garden Description The inscriptions of the sanctuary of Apollo mention nearly 30 kepoi within the period of 433 B.C. to 156/155 B.C., which were either private or belonged to Apollo and were rented or leased. Most of these cannot be localized because they were named after their former owners and with topographical references or surnames unknown today. However, in the years between 167 and 155 B.C., three kepoi were situated near identified buildings: the sanctuary of Leto, the Hippodrome, and the Neorion. A fourth was located near the palaestra, the identification of which among the several palaestra-buildings in Delos is contested. The first three kepoi were located east of the sanctuary of Apollo in a zone which was regarded as specifically humid and fertile because the Inopos, the main watercourse of Delos, was believed to have passed here before emptying into the Bay of Skardhana to the north. However, it has been shown that the Inopos ended south of the sanctuary of Apollo and could therefore never have irrigated the potential garden zone east of Apollo’s sacred precinct.
The kepoi were certainly always located outside the residential quarters and were used as kitchen or commercial gardens. They were identified as terrain for the cultivation of plants that needed irrigation, such as vines, olives, and figs. This terrain had to be enclosed by walls or fences to keep animals out. In contrast to the kepoi, the choria equally mentioned in the inscriptions of the sanctuary of Apollo served for the growing of cereals and stock farming. According to this definition, kepoi could have been laid out either next to farmhouses serving as kitchen gardens or on some of the many cultural terraces which extended far beyond the center of the city to the south, north, and east of the residential zones (Fig. 1). The necessary water supply was provided by wells, reservoirs, and large pools, some of which have been discovered on these terraces. The water was either distributed by hand or through a system of irrigation channels, starting from one of the reservoirs or large pools.
The variety of trees and plants cultivated in ancient Delos is known from the epigraphic evidence. Among the sporadically listed plants are pomegranates, apples, laurel, almonds, palms, vines, figs, and olives. Fig trees, which to this day form the majority of the Delian tree population, appear most often in the inscriptions.

Location PEDROSA DE LA VEGA
La Olmeda (Pleiades)
Location Description The size, quality, and excellent state of preservation of the mosaics of this villa make it an arehaeological jewel. In an area known since the Middle Ages as La Olmeda (the Elm Grove), it was discovered in 1968 by Javier Cortes, the owner of the land, as he was about to level the area for an irrigation project. He immediately recognized its value and involved Pedro de Paloa, a professional archaeologist. Its scientific exploration was financed by Cortes until the site was given to the provincial government in 1980. Excavation continued to 1986. Great care has been taken to preserve the mosaics and lower parts of the villa walls in their original place. In 2005, construction began on a new, 6.2 million euro protective shell and facility to accommodate some 40,000 visitors a year. The Museo Monográfico de la Villa de Pedrosa de la Vega has been created in the old chuch of San Pedro in Saldaña to display the many tools, coins, ceramics, glass and other daily objects from the villa and the extensive nearby cemeteries.
The villa is best reached by a well-marked road turning to the west from CL-615 in Gañinas de la Vega, 3.6 km south of the intersection of CL-615 with CL-624 just south of Saldaña. (CL-615 is the road from Palencia to Saldaña.)
Garden La Olmeda
Keywords  peristyles (Roman courtyards) mosaics (visual works) corridors  Garden Description The major building period dated to the beginning of the 4th century, supplanting an earlier late 1st century phase.. The peristyle garden belonged to the later phase. The house is laid out around its central garden with approximate symmetry relative its north-south axis. The front of the house, the side from which guests entered, was clearly the south where the entry way [25] had a geometric mosaic floor whereas the north entrance way [7] had an earthen floor. Immediately on entry, the guest would have seen the garden through an arcade on its south side. These nine semicircular arches formed a sort of interior façade. This arcade had fallen over – or been pushed pulled over – in the destruction of the house, so it has been possible to reconstruct it in elevation, and it has been rebuilt. The Romans made extensive use of the round arch for practical purposes; this is an interesting example of its use for purely esthetic purposes, since a simple colonnade would have served just as well structurally.
In the center of the nearly square garden was a small fountain which has disappeared. It was surrounded by a small mosaic which survived only as scattered tessera. Crossing the garden in an east-west direction was a pergola. A low wall under the arches prevented guests from entering directly into the garden. Rather, a walk with impressive geometric mosaics led to the main reception room [1] with a vast polychrome mosaic depicting Achilles discovered by Odyssesus among the women of the household of Lycomedes. This mosaic is believed to be one of the largest known figured polychrome mosaic of the Roman world. From the reception room one entered the garden, through the pérgola to the bath complex. The walks around the garden in the porticoes were completely covered with geometric mosaics. A variety of rooms opened off the garden peristyle, offering a variety of spaces for entertaining and activities of daily life. Many did not open directly on the garden but may have had window through which to view the garden. Javier Cortes noted that hardware was found around the edges of the garden suitable for wood vanes which may have closed the spaces between the columns in cold weather. Asked about the quality of the soil in the garden, he replied that it was rich but so was all the soil in this river bottom area.
The large number of objects of daily life found in the ruins, some under toppled walls, makes it clear that the villa was violently destroyed, probably in the second half of the fifth century, though the date is uncertain.

Life in Delos did not come to an abrupt halt as evidenced by remains of Roman thermae and several Christian basilicas, but it continued on a much smaller scale.
Garden Peristyle Gardens
Keywords  impluvia nymphaea (garden structures) oeci peristyles (Roman courtyards)  Garden Description In the Late Hellenistic houses of Delos the impluvia of peristyle courtyards were usually paved, and rainwater falling into these courtyards was emptied as wastewater by sewers into nearby streets. However, in two large houses (Quarter of the Theater, Insula II, Houses E and F) and two clubhouses of associations (House of Fourni; Quarter of the Stadium, Insula I, building B, the so-called perfumery) the impluvia of the peristyle courtyards were not paved, with the exception of some scattered stone settings. Whereas one of them might have been left unfinished in a phase of remodeling (Quarter of the Theater, insula II, House F), the others were certainly all used, comprising of different phases of enlargement and embellishment. Thus, the lack of pavement cannot be due to the unfinished state of the buildings, but must have been deliberate. The sizes of these impluvia range from 30.20 square meters to 75.80 square meters. In all cases no cistern was established under the impluvium, as is usual in Delian buildings with peristyles. Furthermore, all four peristyle courtyards are provided with a sewer for the drainage of rain and waste water; the earthen floor of the impluvium could probably not absorb the occasional large quantities of rain water pouring down in heavy storms, so that at least some of the rain water had to be drained away.
So far, planting was only proposed for the courtyard of the so-called perfumery, but no specialized examinations or excavations were performed in any of the four courtyards. In addition to the above-mentioned characteristics, some other features might speak in favor of luxurious garden-peristyles for these Delian buildings.
The core building of the House of Fourni is arranged along a main axis with rooms on at least three different levels (Fig. 1). The main rooms were not oriented towards the south, as is usual in Delos, but towards the west, thus providing a view of the nearby bay of Fourni and the sea. A kind of nymphaeum (k), carved out of the natural rock and placed exactly on the main axis of the building, was added subsequently to the eastern façade of the building. A broad staircase led from the impluvium of the courtyard (q) to a large raised room in the east (j), a remarkably open oecus maior with doors on three sides and an opening to the nymphaeum on the fourth side. Therefore, the impluvium of 75.80 square meters will have been frequently used and would certainly have been paved, had it not been conceived for a special purpose like planting. Today, the courtyard is (again?) covered with small shrubs. The overall design and some other features like opus signinum pavements (rooms i, h and o) and ‘liturgical’ paintings for the cult of the lares compitales, a cult usually performed by slaves and liberti of Italians or Romans, point to a Roman or Italian association, which might have introduced some new fashionable traits into Delian private architecture.
The so-called perfumery was equipped with a Rhodian peristyle (e), an open oecus maior with colonnades and doors on all four sides (m-n), and with a kind of nymphaeum-reservoir (p) (Figs. 2-3). The latter opened off the oecus maior and was placed on the visual axis of the main entrance. Perfume was produced in a large exedra (f), which was connected with the peristyle to its north by an Ionic colonnade. The overall design is as unique as in the House of Fourni and could well have comprised a peristyle with a stylish garden of 51.20 square meters. A Roman or Italian association might have owned this clubhouse because Romans and Italians showed particular interest in the perfume trade. Slaves and liberti of several gentes that are attested in Delos distinguished themselves as thurarii (dealers of incense) in the Mediterranean world.
The three-sided peristyle in the courtyard (b) of House E in the insula II of the Quarter of the theater comprised a large rectangular altar in its center (Figs. 4-5). An exedra with two columns (f) opened to the north and was only accessible via the impluvium. Again, this arrangement would have required frequent use of the impluvium and, therefore, even more so its systematic pavement. Instead, the impluvium of 48.80 square meters, which is only equipped with some scattered stone slabs, was probably transformed into a kind of sacred garden. Two altars at either side of the entrance, which were probably combined with ‘liturgical’ paintings, might indicate that a Roman or Italian owned this house at least for a certain period.
Whether the impluvium of 30.20 square meters (a) of House F in insula II of the Quarter of the Theater was left unfinished or planned or even realized as a garden, cannot be decided (Fig. 6). Following the latest fashion, the initiators of the last major transformation of this house might well have conceived of a planted impluvium. This house, however, was not (yet?) equipped with any water supply.
In Delian private buildings, peristyle gardens were probably introduced rather late, during the heyday of the free port in the three or four decades before 88 B.C. Within the local context, the Agora of the Italians could have served as the most immediate model for this new fashion. The design of these gardens would have been simple. They would have consisted mostly of small trees, shrubs, and plants, which did not need much water. All of them had to be irrigated by hand, like the garden of the Agora of the Italians and many of the kitchen and commercial gardens, as Late Hellenistic Delos was not provided with a water pipe system.

Province Description The history of Roman Africa begins in 146 BC with the destruction of Carthage and the establishment of the province of Africa in the most fertile part of the Carthaginian Empire. The new province covered about 5000 square miles (17,172 square kilometers) of the northern part of modern Tunisia. A praetor governed the area from his headquarters at Utica. The Romans inherited a thriving agriculture developed by the Carthaginians. The climate was hospitable. Wheat and barley were the most important cereals; wine and olive oil were also produced and there were various fruit trees.
Location [THUBURBO MAIUS (Henchir Kasbat), Tunisia (Pleiades)
Location Description The city occupies the slopes of a hill in a fertile grain producing area about 50 kilometers to the south of Tunis. Originally a settlement of mercenary soldiers after the fall of Carthage, it was raised to amunicipium by Hadrian (117-138), and to a colony during therein of Commodus (177-192). The chief public buildings and the most beautiful homes date from this period. After the crisis of the Empire during the third century, Thuburbo saw a rebirth in the fourth century; but as imperial authority declined the city became a mere village.

      <description>Province Arabia Petraea
Location Petra
Petra (697725)
Garden Petra Garden and Pool Complex
Keywords  archaeobotany artificial islands colonnades garden pavilions horticultural containers pergolas temene terrace gardens water features (landscaping)  Garden Description The only example of a garden investigated using specialized garden archaeology techniques in the region of Arabia Petraea is found at Petra. A large open area was believed to be the site of a marketplace, the so-called “Lower Market,” until excavations revealed the remnants of a formal garden and pool complex. The garden is situated on an artificial terrace on the southern slope of the Wadi Musa, overlooking the main colonnaded street and flanked by the so-called “Middle Market” to the east, and the Great Temple complex to the west. To the south of the garden is a residential quarter on top of a high sandstone ridge (Ez-Zantur), where several private villas have been excavated. Primary access into the garden was apparently from the west, through a triple colonnade that marks the boundary between the Great Temple’s “lower temenos” and the garden terrace.
The garden is composed of two distinct parts: on the north is a large earthen terrace that is elevated approximately six meters above the main street and is level with the Great Temple’s “lower temenos”; to the south of the earthen terrace and elevated another two and a half meters above it is a monumental pool with a central island-pavilion (Fig. 1).
The garden’s earthen terrace measures sixty-five by fifty-three meters and is supported on the north by a double retaining wall. Prior to archaeological study of the site, the terrace appeared devoid of visible architectural features, with the exception of a short stretch of a low wall at its center. The terrace’s southwest quarter has a raised earthen area, bounded on the north and west by reused architectural fragments, attesting to the modern use of the site as an agricultural field by the local Bedouin inhabitants of Petra.
The application of ground-penetrating radar (GPR) provided valuable information about the buried garden. It revealed that the terrace is primarily earthen with a series of stone structures aligned along its central north-south axis. Follow-up excavations uncovered two stone platforms—one at the center of the terrace and one several meters to the south, between the central platform and the pool. Each platform is constructed of a core of unhewn fieldstones faced with sandstone ashlars, typical of Nabataean masonry. There is also evidence that the southern platform was enlarged and redesigned, probably during the Roman and Byzantine periods. At the northern end of the terrace, aligned with the platforms, two soundings exposed the foundations of a large structure that appeared as a pronounced rectangular stone outline (ca. 8.5 x 11 meters) in the GPR data. The gravel interior floor surface and lack of evidence for substantial walls or a roof suggest that it was an open structure, perhaps a pergola, designed to provide shade while viewing the surrounding garden. Remnants of a gravel pathway were uncovered along the central east-west axis (Fig. 2). The pathway’s border is defined by the foundations of a stylobate, suggesting a colonnaded or trellised walkway with bays for constructed views of the garden. Fragments of a flower pot (Fig. 3), perforated for drainage and aeration, were found near the pathway along with several root cavities, which provide evidence for plantings along the path’s edge. Similar flower pot fragments were uncovered during preliminary excavations in the so-called “Upper Market” in 2009 and may be indicative of a second garden site at Petra.
To the south of the garden terrace, the sandstone hillside was quarried out to create a space for a monumental pool. The area of the pool-complex measures sixty-five by thirty-two meters and is bounded on the south and east by vertical sandstone escarpments rising up to sixteen meters above pool-level; to the west is the Eastern Perimeter Wall of the Great Temple complex. A staircase provides access from the garden terrace up to the pool’s west promenade. The pool is a monumental construction with massive walls built to hold approximately 2069 cubic meters (547,000 gallons) of water. Stretching at least forty-six meters across the width of the site, the pool’s north wall measures three and a half meters wide and is preserved to a height of six courses (2.2 m). The wall’s exterior faces are constructed of close-fitting sandstone ashlars typical of Nabataean masonry; between them are alternating rows of roughly hewn sandstone blocks and rubble, bonded into a solid mass with an impervious white mortar. Large rectangular pavers preserved in situ indicate there was once a nicely paved promenade around the pool’s perimeter. Porticoed promenades were commonly associated with ornamental pools of the Hellenistic and Roman periods. To the rear of the pool, a screen wall masks the quarried face of the naturally veined bedrock and displays a central niche and flanking exedrae (only the western exedra has been excavated) that provide focal points at different locations around the pool.
The interior dimensions of the open-air pool measures forty-three by twenty-three meters, and it is two and a half meters deep. Its interior walls and floor are lined with a thick coat of concrete such as is typically used to line Nabataean reservoirs and cisterns. A stone staircase is built into the northeast corner to facilitate entrance into the pool. At the center of the pool is an island-pavilion perched on top of a massive stone plinth (8.5 x 11 x 2.5 m). The pavilion is rectangular in plan with broad, open doorways on at least three sides. Interior columns with marble-faced bases supported the pavilion’s roof. Numerous fragments of painted red stucco, as well as some blue and white, provide some indication of the pavilion’s decorative color scheme. An interior channel or drain cuts diagonally across the floor to connect with a channel that encircles the exterior perimeter of the pavilion, just above the maximum water level of the pool. It is likely that this exterior channel was originally capped and functioned as an overflow channel between pavilion and pool.
Excavations revealed an elaborate water distribution system incorporated into the design and construction of the pool. A holding tank perched on top of the eastern escarpment fed water to the pool and garden below. The pool’s north wall functioned as an aqueduct with channels and pipelines conducting water across the top of the wall to a castellum, or central holding tank and redistribution point built into the wall. Water then exited the castellum and was fed into stone channels that form part of an irrigation system for the garden that was laid out on the earthen terrace. In addition, two large capped channels cut into the bedrock along the eastern edge of the complex may be intended to direct excess or waste water into the wadi. What appears to be a large subterranean cistern fed and drained by pipelines has been identified through GPR in the southeastern quadrant of the terrace, but remains unexcavated.
The archaeological record indicates that the large terrace upon which the garden was found was constructed during the reign of the Nabataean king, Aretas IV (9 B.C. – A.D. 40) and thus it is believed that the garden and monumental pool were initially created at the end of the first century B.C. or early first century A.D. The role of the garden and pool complex within Petra in this earliest phase remains ambiguous. The site is closely associated with the neighboring Great Temple complex. However, the original function of the Great Temple monument remains unsettled, with theories ranging from religious/sacred (temple) to private/royal (possibly a palace or audience hall). Close parallels found in the gardens and pools of the contemporary palaces in neighboring Judaea during the reign of the Hasmonean Dynasty (168-40 B.C.) and Herod the Great (37-4 B. C.) support the interpretation of the Petra garden as part of a palace complex.
The Petra garden continued in use after the Roman annexation of Petra in A.D. 106, at which time the Great Temple was converted into an odeion or bouleutereion. It is likely that, within this context, the garden functioned as a public park much like the urban parks in contemporary Rome. Several examples of evidence for renovations have been identified with this phase of the site. For example, the addition of a bridge allowed easy access to the island-pavilion that was originally only accessible by swimming or possibly boating. In addition, a reorganization of the hydraulic system may represent a new approach to water consumption influenced by the Romans, whose rules about the use of natural resources differed from those of local inhabitants.
A deep deposit of sediment above the pool floor indicates that the pool went out of use or was not well-maintained for a period of time before the collapse of the pavilion walls into the pool as a result of the earthquake of A.D. 363 that caused much destruction in Petra. The remnants of later walls, evidence for the reuse of the hydraulic installations, and a raised field that occupies part of the earthen terrace, testify to the continued use of the site for agricultural purposes through the post-Roman occupation of Petra and into the modern era.

      <description>Province Syria
Location Antioch Antioch (Pleiades)
Location Description Antioch on the Orontes was founded by the Macedonian general Seleucus I as the capital of his Syrian empire, following the breakup of Alexander’s empire (ca. 300 BCE). He selected the site at the edge of the fertile Amuk Plain at the crossroads of important trade routes linking Syria with Palestine, the Mediterranean, and Asia Minor. Antioch was also the capital of the Roman province of Syria, annexed in 64 BCE. In the Augustan period Strabo (16.2.5) compares Antioch favorably to Alexandria in power and size. It was built along the banks of the River Orontes below the craggy heights of Mount Silpios. Because of its advantageous location, Antioch became a cultural, religious, and commercial center in the Roman period. The presence of an imperial residence, as well as buildings for the staging of athletic contests modeled after the Olympic Games, a sanctuary of Apollo, and thermal spa at Daphne, contributed to its renown in the ancient world.
Garden Private Houses at Antioch
Keywords  courtyards fountains mosaics (visual works) statues water features (landscaping)  Garden Description The most significant finds from the international excavations conducted from 1932 to 1939 were the many houses built in and around the city center, on the surrounding terraces of the mountain slopes, in the suburb of Daphne, and in the port of Seleucia Pieria. Scores of floor mosaics dating from the second to the sixth centuries CE paved these houses and brought the private lives of the elite into focus. Although no gardens have been excavated in Antioch, the examination of the figural mosaics, statuary, and the fragmentary remains of house plans suggest that there were private gardens.
During the hot summer months, the wealthy citizens of Antioch retired to Daphne, a settlement on a plateau overlooking the plain of Antioch about five miles south, for cooler breezes and its refreshing springs (Lib. Ep. 419). The suburb was admired for its “varied gardens and charming inns and an abundance of springs and houses hidden in trees and chambers which rise above the groves and luxurious baths…” (Lib. Or. 11.234). The excavations revealed the remains of houses that were richly decorated with mosaics, pools, and fountains. The fact that Daphne was the source for the water carried by two aqueducts to Antioch allowed for a generous use of water in private houses. As in Pompeii, pools and fountains seem to form the natural focal point of house designs. We turn to Libanius, a rhetorician from fourth century CE Antioch, for confirmation of the archaeological evidence: “One can judge the wealth of our waters by the number of the houses, since there are as many fountains as there are houses, or rather there are many fountains in each house” (Lib. Or. 11.246).
Unfortunately, the houses of Antioch were incompletely excavated and their state of preservation makes it difficult to distinguish the boundaries of individual houses or even the entrances into rooms. This leaves many questions, including the evidence for gardens, unanswered. The third century CE House of Menander at Daphne provides the most complete plan from Antioch, but it can only hint at the possibility of a garden (Fig. 1). The most typical feature of Antiochene houses is the sequential arrangement of the dining room, columned court, and fountain or pool (e.g., House of Menander, House of the Boat of the Psyches, House of the Drinking Contest). A similar alignment of spaces occurs in the House of Bacchus and Ariadne in Thuburbo Maius, modern Tunisia, where the diners could look out from two different dining rooms through a columned screen to a mosaic basin and beyond into a garden area (one is a peristyle garden; the other is a courtyard garden) where evidence of plantings was found. It would seem from such parallels, including the evidence of many excavated gardens in Pompeii, that plantings in the peristyles and courts were closely aligned with dining vistas and water features. One might reasonably conjecture that the courtyards and pseudo-peristyle areas with fountains and pools in the House of Menander at Daphne contained potted plants. As most of the areas of the excavated houses at Antioch were paved with mosaic, it seems less likely that there were open soil areas for plantings of evergreen trees as found in Pompeii, such as the House of Polybios. However, given the nearby topos of the cypress-filled grove of Daphne with its gurgling thermal springs and the original laurel bush (see Sacred Grove at Daphne), it is not difficult to imagine greenery inserted into the courtyards and areas accented by niched fountains and pools in the Antiochene houses.

      <description>Province Syria
Province Description In 64 BCE, after his successes in Armenia, Pompey the Great added Syria to the list of annexed eastern provinces of the growing Roman Empire. The conquest of Syria had not been difficult, because the remnants of the once dominant Seleucid Empire had weakened following the defeats of king Antiochus III at Thermopylae in 191 and Magnesia in Asia shortly after. Ultimately, the Seleucids could not withstand the powers of the Nabatean kingdom to the south, the Hasmonean kingdom to the west, and the new threats of Roman hegemony. With the fall of the Seleucids, Rome inherited the majority of Alexander the Great’s former conquests, and the Syrian desert would become a stage for Roman emperors to settle civil conflicts and win triumphs. Smaller Arab settlements sprang up across the region, re-inhabiting Seleucid sites and establishing new ones, and cities such as Palmyra grew in power by taking over the wealthy trade routes of the Nabateans in the second century CE. The Syrian city of Antioch, formerly Seleucia, would become one of the greatest cities of the Roman empire. Although Macedonian presence in the region introduced western styles in art and architecture before the arrival of the Romans, the cities remained Syrian in culture, population and character.
Covering the substantial central part of the Fertile Crescent, the province of Syria sat in an advantageous position between the mountain ranges of eastern Anatolia, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Arabian deserts, and it served as an area of expansion for the larger kingdoms around it. Important trans-Asian trade routes made Syria a key component in the Roman imperial economy, and large navigable rivers, such as the Euphrates and the Orontes, were exploited to connect the Persian Gulf with northern cities. The climate, although arid in the inland mountainous areas, was quite conducive to cultivation. River valleys in the mountain chains skirting the coast provided fertile terrain for agriculture, and the Orontes and Euphrates created well-watered plateaus in the steppe and desert regions of the southeast.
An irrigation system based around the qanat, an underground water channel, was used in Syria during the Roman period to water fields and gardens. Although qanats were likely introduced to the region via the earlier Achaemenid Persian dynasty, it was during the Roman and Byzantine periods that irrigation technology improved, and the majority of known qanats date to this time. The water could flow from these channels into canals, small reservoirs known today as birkas, or large wells. The ancient field systems of Syria have been well studied in areas such as the Hauran, a basalt region in the south. Cereals, olives and grapes were important crops, and were cultivated in either the broad fields on the lowland plains, or long, segmented plots on terraces in the rocky highlands. These terraced plots would have held fruit trees or vineyards.

Garden Sacred Grove at Daphne
Keywords  sacred groves  Garden Description Antioch was most famous for its public gardens, such as the sacred grove of Daphne in the precinct of Apollo. The sanctuary was described by Strabo as a “large, thickly shaded grove intersected by fountain streams in the midst of which there is an asylum precinct and a temple of Apollo and Artemis” (16.2.6). This impression is reinforced in the lecture given in 360 CE by Libanius who praises Daphne for “the number and thickness and height of the cypresses, the shady paths, the choruses of singing birds, the even breeze, the odors sweeter than spices, the stately aqueducts, the vines trained to form banqueting hall – these are the gardens of Alcinous…a veritable Sybaris” (Lib. Or. 11.236).
Of Hellenistic origin, the site was famous during the Roman period for its cypress (Cupressus sp.) grove (Libanius, Or. 11.234-243; Strabo, 16.2.6). There is art historical and textual evidence for the grove, but no archaeological excavations of the grove have been undertaken nor has the precinct been defined. According to Libanius, Seleucus dedicated Daphne to Apollo because he found one of the arrow heads that Apollo had shot off in anger after the transformation of Daphne into a laurel (Laurus nobilis) (Libanius, Or. 11.94-99). According to the myth, it was here that the eponymous nymph, daughter of Ge and river god Ladon, was pursued and overtaken by Apollo at which point she was transformed into the laurel (Greek daphne, Fig. 2). In his disappointment at losing the nymph, Apollo shot all of his arrows, among which was one with his name that fell into the earth. When Seleucus found this buried arrow, he honored the discovery by creating a sacred enclosure, planting a grove of cypress trees, and dedicating a temple of Apollo (Lib. Or. 11.94-99). The esteem in which the grove at Daphne was held is attested by Libanius who remarks that he will write the emperor himself when an official threatened to cut the cypresses (Lib. Or. I.262-3). Reportedly, Seleucus planted a cypress grove and constructed a temple at the site (Sozomen, Hist. eccl., 5.19). Malalas (204.9-16) writes that Herakles planted a cypress grove and that the Heraklia was located outside the grove near the temple of Athena. Philostratus, however, reports a different story about the grove: the Landon worshipped the laurel. A cypress grove surrounded the temple, and a single cypress sapling grew naturally in honor of Cyparissus, an Assyrian youth who also experienced a metamorphosis (Philostratus, V A, 1.16).
The purposeful evocation of a sacred landscape can be seen in the placement of the temple near the spring Castalia in which the oracle of Apollo was considered to reside. A representation of the journey from the springs of Daphne to Antioch along a tree-lined street is picturesquely depicted in the topographic border of the mosaic of Megalopsychia found in the mid-fifth century CE villa at Daphne (Yakto area) (Fig. 3). Water flows from a vase held by a nude female, identified by a Greek inscription as the personification “Kastalia,” into a semi-circular colonnaded nymphaeum. Another stream of water flows from her into a reservoir with another nymph identified as “Pallas,” but there is no sign of the sacred grove or the temple. In addition, the grove was the symbol for Daphne on a medieval copy of the Tabula Peutingeriana (4th century CE). Though archaeologists have not found any material traces of the revered grove at Daphne, there is archaeological evidence for the planting of groves at the Sanctuary of Apollo Hylates (“He of the woodlands”) in Kourion, Cyprus, and elsewhere (see: cross-references here).

Garden Shrine Complex in Insula E125
Keywords  aqueducts basins (vessels) insulae naoi (chambers) planters (containers) shrines (structures) temene  Garden Description A few decades after a Nabataean shrine at Hawara (Roman Havarra) had been severely damaged during the Roman conquest of Arabia Petraea, the site’s inhabitants built another shrine at the same location. The Roman period shrine occupied the southeast corner of a multi-unit insula (E125), but could only be accessed from outside the complex. This shrine consisted of a square naos (containing the cult statue and votive offerings) enclosed in a rectangular open-air temenos (Figs. 1-2). Upon entering the temenos, worshippers walked to the naos along a 20 m long paved processional way that was flanked by two long raised planters. An aqueduct-fed basin next to the door of the naos appears to have supplied the shrine with so much fresh water that it must have been intended not just for ritual cleansing, but for supplying the planters as well. Given the relatively shallow depth of the planters, and that no root balls or pots were found within, they probably contained shrubs and/or flowers rather than trees. Although the architect clearly tried to make the planters symmetrical in size, shape, and location, their design (and that of the whole Roman shrine) was constrained by the reuse of some Nabataean walls as foundations.

Location Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s Villa (Pleiades)
Location Description DESCRIPTION
Villa Adriana, erected by emperor Hadrian at the beginning of the II cent. A.D., occupies a vast area of 126 hectares. It was a beautiful estate strategically located near Tivoli and, at the same time, not very far from Rome (WINNEFELD 1895; KÄHLER 1950; AURIGEMMA 1961; RAKOB 1973; BROWN 1964). Prior to the Hadrianic settlement, an ancient villa, dating back to the late republican time, already stood there. Probably it belonged to Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s family and, as a matter of fact, many scholars think that Hadrian chose this estate as the ideal one because he already knew the place and was attached to it (LUGLI 1927). Certainly he preserved and restored the original building and made it the nucleus of his private quarters.
The realization of this magnificent residence must have been a cherished dream of Hadrian, and he must have planned it long before becoming an emperor. This is the only way to explain how the works for its construction began immediately after his election and his return to Rome in 118 A.D. Hadrian died in 138 A.D. when his ideal residence was nearly completed. Nearly, because there was still some work to be done. Some important halls of the Great Baths were not finished, and the model for a Stadium, found among the ruins of his last building-yard in the quarters of the stonecutters (CAPRINO 1996-97; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992-93, p. 73; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 144-147; REGGIANI 1997), was never brought to the unknown place where Hadrian had planned to build it. The Emperor&amp;rsquo;s death put an abrupt end to all activities, and some of the gardens he planned to create, and for which fountains and pavilions had already been built, were never done or, if ever they were completed, seem to have been soon abandoned (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992-93, pp. 000-000). As a matter of fact after him Villa Adriana was only partially lived in by his successors and was solely used for occasional visits. It became just one of the many country houses pertaining to the imperial praedia. Some of the existing gardens (Fig. 1), the ones nearer to the center of the residence and the monumental ones, were maintained and irrigated up to the end of the Roman Empire, a fact which is now proved by the concentration of extractable lead found in their soil, and which is due to the use of lead pipes for irrigation (FOSS ET ALII 1990; FOSS 1989-90; FOSS 1992; TIMPSON ET ALII 1994; FOSS, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1996). As a consequence of Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s death, some others sites, which he had planned to be attractive and important, got no irrigation at all, thus their soil contains only a minimal quantity of extractable lead, about the same amount that is ordinarily found in modern agricultural fields.
Garden The gardens at the entrance of Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s villa (Fig. 1, n. 3)
Keywords  flower gardens peristyles (Roman courtyards) tufa  Garden Description The Great Entrance Hall of Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s villa (Fig. 9) presents three gardens, two of which (Fig. 9, A and G) are peristyle ones.
a – The main gate to the Hadrianic residence opens up on a peristyle garden, the largest one. Having just been excavated by Dr. Anna Maria Reggiani, the Latium&amp;rsquo;s Superintendent, it is published by her at p. 000 .
b –The other garden (Figs. 9, G, and 10-11), set at the eastern side of the entrance hall, occupies a smaller peristyle with a curved side toward East (REICHARDT 1933). It was crossed in the middle by a path which had a round-shaped space in the center (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1987, pp. 175-178, figs. 13-20; JASHEMSKI, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1987-88, p. 147, figs. 1-2; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1998, pp. 364-366, fig. 1; MARI, REGGIANI, RIGHI 2000; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 323-324, fig. 110). Here some decorative element - a marble vase or a statue - was probably displayed. Two flowerbeds cut in the tufa flanked it (Figs. 10, G, and 11). We are still pretty sure that they were bordered by well-groomed box hedges, a kind of decoration which was afterwards inherited by the “all&amp;rsquo;italiana” system of landscaping. This fashion, widely employed in many outstanding examples of Renaissance gardens, is still in use nowadays. The presence of well cut green hedges bordering those ancient flowerbeds was a must and it is a sure fact that they existed here, but we know very little about the rest. For instance, what, if anything, could have been set in their central part? Prof. Jashemski found pollen, seeds, roots of flowering bushes and of some trees in her Pompeian gardens, but here at Villa Adriana nothing was left in the ground. We are bound to follow our imagination. Of course there could have been grass in the center of the flowerbeds as well as masses of blossoms. If the latter was the case - but, looking to “all&amp;rsquo;italiana” gardens, which are basically green gardens, I highly doubt it - the flowers should have been the kinds which were in fashion in ancient Roman times. In his Natural History (nat. 21.10), Pliny the Older explained that Romans didn&amp;rsquo;t use many of them. In their gardens they mainly planted roses and violets. However we must keep in mind that, for Pliny, the word violets meant every kind of small herbaceous species that could produce colored blossoms. He catalogued many kinds of them as the yellow, the purple, and the white kind, and it is highly probable that they must have been pimpernels as well as hyacinths and, of course real violets too. It is, however, evident that any of these plants could create gay clusters of blossoms in the center of a flowerbed and that they could make a very appealing garden.
c – The third garden of the Great Entrance Hall occupies its extreme western part (REICHARDT 1933, pp. 129-130). Here an unpaved courtyard circled a small temple, probably dedicated to the Imperial Lares (Fig. 9, L). The flowerbeds have still to be excavated, but, as in all the Great Entrance Hall&amp;rsquo;s area the tufa is practically surfacing, this must happen also here. Therefore it is highly probable that an excavation will bring to light the flowerbeds cut in the rock for the plants.

Location Description Annexed in 46 B.C., the Romanization of the city of Thugga that was probably a residence of the Numidian kings, was gradual but profound. It became Municipium Thuggense in 205, and was raised to the rank of a Colonia Licinia Septima Aurelia Alexandriana Thuggensesin in 261 under Gallien. Numerous buildings of this city overlooking the valley of the Ouadi Khaled, have been uncovered among them the Capitol dedicated to the Capitoline Triad in 166-67, the theater on the top of the plateau constructed under Antonius Pius, the Temple of Mercury, Fortune, Augustan Piety, Liber Pater, Concordia, Frugifer, Pluto, Saturn and the Temple of Caelestis which stands in the middle of a an olive grove. In the residential areas stands the Licinian Baths with their Palestrae and the Cyclops Baths and the Triumphal Arch of Septimus Severus set astride a street leading down the hill. Two building inscriptions (CIL VIII, 26606 and CIL VIII, 26607), dated to AD 166-169 mention a theater with a basilica, porticoes, and xystis.

      <description>Province Syria
Province Description In 64 BCE, after his successes in Armenia, Pompey the Great added Syria to the list of annexed eastern provinces of the growing Roman Empire. The conquest of Syria had not been difficult, because the remnants of the once dominant Seleucid Empire had weakened following the defeats of king Antiochus III at Thermopylae in 191 and Magnesia in Asia shortly after. Ultimately, the Seleucids could not withstand the powers of the Nabatean kingdom to the south, the Hasmonean kingdom to the west, and the new threats of Roman hegemony. With the fall of the Seleucids, Rome inherited the majority of Alexander the Great’s former conquests, and the Syrian desert would become a stage for Roman emperors to settle civil conflicts and win triumphs. Smaller Arab settlements sprang up across the region, re-inhabiting Seleucid sites and establishing new ones, and cities such as Palmyra grew in power by taking over the wealthy trade routes of the Nabateans in the second century CE. The Syrian city of Antioch, formerly Seleucia, would become one of the greatest cities of the Roman empire. Although Macedonian presence in the region introduced western styles in art and architecture before the arrival of the Romans, the cities remained Syrian in culture, population and character.
Covering the substantial central part of the Fertile Crescent, the province of Syria sat in an advantageous position between the mountain ranges of eastern Anatolia, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Arabian deserts, and it served as an area of expansion for the larger kingdoms around it. Important trans-Asian trade routes made Syria a key component in the Roman imperial economy, and large navigable rivers, such as the Euphrates and the Orontes, were exploited to connect the Persian Gulf with northern cities. The climate, although arid in the inland mountainous areas, was quite conducive to cultivation. River valleys in the mountain chains skirting the coast provided fertile terrain for agriculture, and the Orontes and Euphrates created well-watered plateaus in the steppe and desert regions of the southeast.
An irrigation system based around the qanat, an underground water channel, was used in Syria during the Roman period to water fields and gardens. Although qanats were likely introduced to the region via the earlier Achaemenid Persian dynasty, it was during the Roman and Byzantine periods that irrigation technology improved, and the majority of known qanats date to this time. The water could flow from these channels into canals, small reservoirs known today as birkas, or large wells. The ancient field systems of Syria have been well studied in areas such as the Hauran, a basalt region in the south. Cereals, olives and grapes were important crops, and were cultivated in either the broad fields on the lowland plains, or long, segmented plots on terraces in the rocky highlands. These terraced plots would have held fruit trees or vineyards.

Garden Tomb garden at Tyre
Keywords  tombs basins (vessels) niches  Garden Description A tomb garden (Tomb Complex 15) has been found in a cemetery complex dating to the fourth century CE. (Fig. 1) Excavated by Maurice Chéhab, it features an enclosed garden (18x21 m) surrounded by a wall. The west wall supports a water channel which fed a rectangular basin in the apsidal hall and a large square basin in the northeast corner of the garden. (Fig. 2) A small square basin was installed by the great basin to catch the water and transmit it to channels in the garden itself. Along the central axis of the garden postholes were found, suggesting a free-standing trellis, or perhaps some form of fence. Other features of the walls include decorative niches, possibly for sculpture. No evidence for plants has been recovered, but from the structural arrangement, it is clearly a garden. Such tomb gardens provided a gracious place for visiting the dead and perhaps for growing produce for offerings and subsidizing the maintenance of the complex.

The series of wealthy villae, such as that of La Cocosa, Milreu or San Cucufate are particularly noteworthy. Another of the important elements of the Roman era is the series of still visible ways of communication, of which the Vía de la Plata has most remaining, especially in the sections of Baños de Montemayor in Cáceres or the bridges that cross the rivers, such as that of San Pedro de Alcántara, or of Mérida.

Quadratus, of the Galeria tribe, who made for himself a tomb monument with, it seems, a ‘circumvallation’ and a pavilion (cum munitioni[bus], tric[le]a[e]). Although no tomb garden is mentioned explicitly, the reference to a pavilion points to the presence of one; by ‘circumvallation’ (munitiones) Quadratus evidently means the perimeter wall that regularly enclosed tomb gardens.

The villa from the middle of the 2nd century evolved around a peristyle garden with a large circular pool, 7.6 meters in inside diameter, in the middle. A paved corridor led to the pool from the north gallery of the peristyle. There were baths and two rooms with mosaic floors. Most rooms, however, had floors of hammered earth.

Garden Villa el Hinojal
Keywords  peristyles (Roman courtyards) hypocausts  Garden Description In the early 1970&amp;rsquo;s, J. M. Álvarez Martinez began excavations at this site, whose report appeared in 1976. The villa was built around a central open space (11.7 x 6.3 m), which the archaeologists initially assumed was a peristyle. There was indeed a wall (0.70 meters high and 0.55 meters thick) around the central area, which was judged to a garden. But there was no trace of columns or bases or capitals of even imprints of where they had been. The passageways around the courtyard on the north, west, and south were definitely covered; and on the east, where the entrances to the walled area were, there was probably also a portico, for that wall had painted decoration which would hardly have been left exposed to the weather. The garden gave light to the rooms around it.
Though it seems clear that the principal room [10], with a mosaic representing the hunting of wild boar, was intended to have a view of the garden through its large entranceway, there was no gate to the garden at that point and the view must have been at least partially blocked by the wall around the garden. Inside the garden area there were also some low walls, presumably the edges of planting beds. A well was in the center of the garden, and a water conduit led off to the northwest where there were baths. In an unusual arrangement, there appear to have been baths also in the northeastern corner. Both areas had hypocausts and water-handling facilities.
The house appears to have been built at the end of the third or beginning of the fourth century A.D. However, there were bits of ceramic from the first, second and third centuries used as filler in the foundation beds below the mosaics. Abandonment seems to have come at the end of the fourth or early in the fifth century. The house thus presents a number of unusual features, including a ‘peristyle’ without columns, two baths in a relatively small house, a grand room with a view of the garden but blocked by a wall, and first century ceramic filler in a house that otherwise appears to date from around 300 AD. The excavation is still incomplete and the definitive report yet to be written.

Garden Villa de La Cocosa
Keywords  peristyles (Roman courtyards) mosaics (visual works) podiums (building divisions)  Garden Description Rock is very scarce in this region, so it happened that sometime around 1940 workers removing stones from the ruined walls of this villa found the mosaic floor of the tepidarium. The owner informed the authorities in Badajoz, archaeologists were brought in, and the villa was fully excavated. A few years later, José de C. Serra Ráfols was entrusted with the job of mapping the site and preparing documentation based on his own work and the notes of his predecessors. His ample text of 173 pages plus 28 drawings and 37 photographs appeared in 1952. The mosaic from the tepidarium with a hippocampus (marine centaur) surrounded by dolphins and fish is in the Museo de Bellas Artes in Badajoz. This excavation, however, was done long before the interest in the archaeology of gardens, so it is hardly surprising that almost nothing is said about them.
The villa had a peristyle courtyard, (13 x 17 m), but as found, it was paved with a floor of crushed bricks embedded in concrete. It was not, however, necessarily always paved. Serra Ráfols felt that the original villa went back to the middle of the first century A.D, and that it was considerably amplified and given some mosaic floors in the middle of the second century A.D. Then later came proprietors “who felt a veritable passion for rustic pavements of crushed brick in concrete, which they put down everywhere” (p. 162). Previously, the inner court of the peristyle had presumably been a garden. The paved floor of the peristyle is some 18 centimeters below the level of the surrounding galleries. Around the perimeter of the central court, some 35 cm from the edge of the galleries, they built a wall about 30 cm high and 65 cm wide. The top of the wall was mostly flat but at the edges it had upward slanting lips that made of the whole a sort of shallow trough. It was too shallow to be for ornamental water, so Serra Ráfols conjectured that it was a sort of podium for potted plants. It would have elevated the plants somewhat and caught any excess of water given them. Indeed, it might have been especially nice for potted flowers, for it would bring their blossoms closer to eye level and also allow for frequent changes in order always to have plants in bloom. This structure is intact at the northwest corner of the peristyle (Fig. 2).
Twelve of the twenty column bases were found in place. A granite shaft 40 cm in diameter was also found, likely originally encased in ornamental stucco. There was a small semicircular pool, probably the basin of a fountain, in the middle of the west side of the peristyle. Similar small pools are found between the first and second columns from the west along the north and south sides.
Besides the central peristyle, there are several other areas that were possibly gardened. In the center of the west wing, area (Fig. 2, 12) was an unpaved, elongated courtyard that might well have had informal plantings such as fruit trees, figs, pomegranates, or oleanders. Between the rooms along the west side of the peristyle and the baths (69 – 87) at the eastern edge of the excavated area there was a large open area. It was probably a palaestra and not gardened. But south of it was an open area bounded on the east by the aqueduct (83 and 103) where a grave (105) was later dug. It could well have been a garden for vegetables or for the potted plants which were brought into peristyle in their season. Still further south, the area (88) to the southeast of the peristyle was open, but was probably more a farmyard than a garden. Even further south there was yet another courtyard (95) which could have been a garden, especially since a drain (97) led away from it. Little remains of the surrounding spaces; possibly they were storerooms. What seem to have been presses for oil or wine and a grain mill complete the picture of an agricultural establishment.

Estoi (Pleiades)
Garden Villa de Milreu
Keywords  peristyles (Roman courtyards)  Garden Description The ruins of this villa are 0.9 km west of the center of Estoi. Strabo (3.2.5) mentions Ossonoba as a town on an estuary in this part of Lusitania. The Roman temple at the Milreu site, still standing to the springline of its vaults, always marked this spot as a Roman settlement, and many concluded that it must be Ossonoba. Among those of this opinion was Sebastião Philippes Martins Estácio da Veiga, who first excavated the site in 1877. He wrote that he had “brought to light the famous cathedral of Ossonoba.” Controversy swirled over the identification of the ruins as it became increasingly clear that they were those of an affluent villa. The dispute was not resolved until 1952 when Abel Viana produced irrefutable evidence that the ruins of Ossonoba lie under modern Faro.
The entrance, to the south of the villa, was flanked by semicircular pools at the near ends of gardened strips. Through a vestibule, one entered the peristyle (24.3 x 28.0 m). In the center was a deep pool, but around it ample space for a garden. The porticoes surrounding the peristyle were paved with mosaics. The late ones, from the mid-third century A.D., depict fish, dolphins, and mollusks with exceptional care; the earlier ones are primarily geometric. In the fish, the tesserae get smaller around the head, teeth, and eyes. Given this interest in marine life, it seems likely that the deep pool in the garden had fish.
On the west side of the peristyle, the triclinium was centered on the garden and its pool. There are traces of stone bases for the three couches, so we can be sure that the room was for dining rather than reception or business. At the west end, the triclinium had an apse. Farther west, the land dropped off rapidly, so that there was an excellent view in that direction. A walkway wrapped around the north, south, and west sides of the triclinium, to allow enjoyment of the vista. It therefore seems likely that the area close to the house on the west side would have been gardened. Moreover, there would have been plenty of water from the runoff of the baths, which were just next to the triclinium on the south.
The peristyle of this villa was a productive one. Five olive presses sat in the northwest corner of the peristyle but at a lower level. Wine presses were placed in a structure on the northeast corner of the peristyle. Much of this northeast area is now covered by a 15th century farmhouse. The Roman structures beneath it have been excavated and are visible through the modern glass floors of the farmhouse, a clever and effective way to preserve and present the Roman material while also preserving the attractive and historic farmhouse.
The archaeologists working on the site have not produced a detailed sequence of phases. Settlement on the site, however, seems to go back to the Bronze Age, while the first Roman structures date from the first century A.D. The second and third centuries A.D. saw the villa assume approximately its present form. The fine marine mosaics, found not only around the peristyle but in several of the numerous pools, date from the mid-fourth century AD. The temple was contemporaneous and appears to have been originally pagan, though before the end of the century it had been converted to a Christian church.

Garden Villa de Torre de Palma
Keywords  mosaics (visual works) apsed triclinium peristyles (Roman courtyards) doliums  Garden Description This villa was discovered by farm workers in 1947, and excavations were begun soon afterwards by the Museu Etnológico (now the Museu Arqueológico) in Lisbon. Hundreds of rooms were unearthed, and major mosaics and many crates of materials were removed to the museum. In 1983, American archaeologists from the University of Louisville became involved with the site through a project to re-excavate the Christian basilica in the northern end. When the 1983 campaign found coins from the mid fourth century A.D. embedded in the original floor of the basilica – thereby establishing it as the earliest known double-apsed church on the Iberian Peninsula – it became clear that much might be learned from re-excavation of the whole site with modern methods.
There is one space which was likely gardened as well as several other likely spots. The report of the University of Louisville team distinguishes a number of phases. The relative chronology is based largely on the identification of the building techniques of successive master masons, while absolute dates are determined from ceramics and embedded coins found during excavations in the 1980s. The first phase consists mainly of finds of ceramics and coins from the middle of the first century A.D. but includes also the little two-room structure in the East court.
In Phase 2 (Fig. 2), from the end of the first century to mid-second century A.D., an atrium-based house was constructed and, south of it, a large peristyle courtyard. Though the atrium was unusually large with six columns rather than four &amp;ndash; what Vitruvius called a ‘Corinthian’ atrium &amp;ndash; it seems unlikely to have been gardened. The peristyle courtyard to the south, marked East Court in Figure 2, is a much more probable area, not for a formal garden but for the kind of informal garden. The entrance to the house was from the south through this peristyle. To the west was an even larger courtyard but without a peristyle. The rooms around it were modest homes with hearths and an occasional half-buried dolium. The central area may have been more farmyard than garden but quite likely had some vegetables. The “Portico House” on the southeast corner is noteworthy for its “modern” design with the porches around the house rather than the house around the porches. The central hall may have been open to serve as a light well.
The third phase distinguished by Maloney and Hale covered several building campaigns and extended through the second half of the 3rd and perhaps into the very beginning of the 4th century AD. The northeast corner of the house was largely demolished and rebuilt with a central peristyle courtyard. A rather deep tank was in the center, and between it and the peristyle was an unpaved area that was almost certainly a garden, quite possibly formal. The granaries that had previously occupied part of the buildings around the east court were surpressed, indicating an “urbanization” or up-scaling of the area. The entrance remained on the south; the visitor would still have crossed the east court to get to the main house. The villa’s triclinium had a full, central view of the garden and pool. The tablinum or master&amp;rsquo;s office on the east side of the peristyle also had a fine view of the garden.

Keywords  peristyles (Roman courtyards) mosaics (visual works)  Garden Description Built in the second half of the 2nd century CE, it was destroyed during the invasions of the Franks after 256. Following the recovery of the Empire under Claudius II and Aurelian (268 -275), it was rebuilt and enlarged, surviving into the 5th century. Water was brought to the villa by a conduit from 1.5 km further up the Sequillo. The villa is built around two peristyles of similar size. The surrounding rooms featured more than 30 mosaics. The western peristyle (11 x 11 m) was built first, with porticoes on all four sides of its central garden, and, a double gallery on the north side against the summer sun. The later, eastern half had a slightly larger peristyle (12.5 x 21 m), with galleries on three sides of its garden. A large hall extended directly off the fourth side. The peristyle was richly adorned with sculptures, mosaics, and mural paintings.

      <description>Province Lusitania Lusitania (Pleiades)
Province Description Despite the prior existence of urban centers like Metellinum, the capital of Lusitania was a new foundation, the Colonia Augusta Emerita (Mérida), which would also serve as the capital of one of the smaller juridical units (conventus) and would be the scene of flourishing activity in the succeeding centuries, its prosperity lasting until the late Roman and Visigothic era. Subsequently, a series of well-known Roman cities were built in what was then Lusitania but is now partly in Portugal and partly in Spain. As well as the capital, there were Conimbriga, Salmantica, Evora, Olisipo (now Lisbon), Pax Iulia (now Beja), and Metallium Viscascense (Aljustrel), this last recognized as the capital of an important mining area. The series of wealthy villae, such as that of La Cocosa, Milreu or San Cucufate are particularly noteworthy. Another of the important elements of the Roman era is the series of still visible ways of communication, of which the Vía de la Plata has most remaining, especially in the sections of Baños de Montemayor in Cáceres or the bridges that cross the rivers, such as that of San Pedro de Alcántara, or of Mérida.

Garden Villa Sao Cucufate
Keywords  tablina peristyles (Roman courtyards)  Garden Description This villa, which lies southeast of Lisbon, had multiple construction phases, investigated by J. Alarcão, R. Etienne, and F. Mayet. The key to distinguishing the first villa from the second turned out to be that the first was made of granite without mortar, while the second was built of schist. It was a modest structure with a patio [Fig. 1, 7], quite possibly an informal garden, surrounded on two sides by galleries [6]. Rooms [3], [4], and [5] were the family&amp;rsquo;s living quarters. Half-buried jars made clear that room [10] was a storeroom, presumably for grain, oil, and wine. Dating this phase is uncertain; some terra sigillata suggests a date in the mid 1st century.
About 130 AD, the family demolished much of its home and built in its place a much more spacious abode, which preserved the orientation and the width of the farmyard from the first phase. To the northwest, the old patio and its galleries gave way to a whole new structure: a peristyle with galleries on all four sides surrounded a central garden with a semicircular pool. The pool was a bit off-center, and the garden was aligned with the new principal room of the house, perhaps a tablinum, on the northwest side of the peristyle. Behind this room, further to the northwest, was a huge water tank holding some 800 cubic meters. The source of the water has not been identified. This tank supplied water to the pool, baths, and several smaller pools and fountains. Overflow from this tank was collected in a similar tank of half the capacity farther down the hill to the south. It could have served as a swimming pool in the summer and to irrigate gardens and orchards farther down the slope. The rooms on the southwest side of the peristyle opened onto a broad veranda with a good view. The rooms just to the east of the veranda were baths; their waste water would have irrigated the gardens. With this source of abundant water, it seems safe to guess that the very visible area just below the veranda was gardened. A small fountain with semicircular pool graced the northeastern end of the gallery behind the colonnade.
In about 360 AD much of the old villa was demolished and a new, two-story structure erected. The lower floor rose some seven meters high with barrel vaults so well built that many are still standing. The grand house of the owner was on the upper floor. The key to seeing the relation of this third phase to the second phase is the large water tank, which was preserved. Comparison of Figures 2 and 3 shows that the semicircular pool of the second phase peristyle survived, and that the galleries along the southwestern and northeastern sides of the peristyle were considerably extended. In fact, a guest entering from the main façade and bound for the elegant upper story would have to pass along the southeastern gallery to get to the stairs. That fact, coupled with the preservation of the pool, strongly suggests the former peristyle garden was maintained and extended along with the gallery.
The upper floor did not have a garden but offered splendid views of gardens, both in front and behind the house. Between the two end towers stretched, on the southwest (front) side, a roofed veranda over 40 meters long with a sturdy wooden rail. This emphasis on the vista leaves little doubt that the well-watered area in foreground, through which the guests arrived, would have been beautifully developed as a garden.
