Garden Casa di Galba
Keywords  stuccoing porticoes peristyle houses exedrae  Garden Description The excavation of this site was begun in 1873-1874 and is still incomplete. A silver bust, supposedly of the emperor Galba, found in the street in front of this house gave the site its name. Twelve stuccoed tuffa columns support a portico which encloses this peristyle garden. A marble faced cruciform basin in the center contained a small column with a fountain. The columns were connected by a low wall with an entrance on the east opposite the exedra providing a view of the garden and fountain.

Garden B
Keywords  atrium peristyles stuccoing  Garden Description B. From the atrium the peristyle on the lower level was reached by way of a steeply sloping corridor. Stuccoed brick columns and a low wall 0.50 m. high enclosed the central area (b) and a large gutter collected water from the edges and conducted it to the cistern. A rectangular pool ca. 2.60 x 5.00 m. with the inside painted blue was located in the center of this area. At the rear of the pool an area paved with bipedales (tiles two feet long) covered the cellars below with an opening 1.70 x 2.20 to provide light. Jashemski noted that the paved and planted areas were reconstructed with a lattice fence between them, although she did not know of any evidence to support this interpretation.
