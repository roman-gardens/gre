Garden Rural Villa in Winden Am See
Keywords  archaeological garden corridors rural villas vestibules villae rusticae  Garden Description The modest house of this villa rustica is of the so-called corridor type, a type common in the region and already seen at Carnuntum (Fig. 1). It was built around 100 A.D. and occupied until the 4th century.
On the southeast of the house was a vestibule, from which a central corridor departed at a 90 degree angle. This corridor divided the house into two parts of equal width. Two walls at right angles to the house at the northeast enclosed an area in which the excavators found &amp;ldquo;fine garden soil.&amp;rdquo; This observation allows the reconstruction of a garden, probably a kitchen garden, next to the house (G in Fig. 1).

Location Carnuntum
Carnuntum (Pleiades)
Location Description The town of Carnuntum on the Danube River, like Aquincum, was promoted to colonial status in 194 A.D., after having been a municipium. Excavations in the modern zoological garden have revealed part of the town plan and its residential district.
Garden Urban Houses in Carnuntum
Keywords  arcades (structural assemblies) archaeological garden corridors kitchen gardens vestibules  Garden Description The regional house type found often in Pannonia, the so-called corridor house, is characterized by a vestibule or arcade on its narrow front and a central corridor running the length of the house, separating it into two parts. One of these houses (B on plan) on a street corner in Carnuntum exhibits this plan clearly (Fig. 1). South of the house, facing the street and separate from it, are various rooms which were interpreted as shops and workshops. North of the house is an open unpaved courtyard which is usually assumed to have been a garden, perhaps a kitchen garden (G on plan). The neighboring house (A in Fig. 1) to the east is of similar plan, if somewhat more irregular, and it too has an open courtyard at the north (G on plan).
