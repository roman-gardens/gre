Keywords  textrina portico puteal  Garden Description 548.V.4/3. There was a courtyard (a) in the center of this house which was apparently attached to a textrina. The courtyard was surrounded by a portico with seven supporting brick columns. These were connected by a low wall and a second wall on the inside was slightly lower and formed a gutter. A terra-cotta puteal was located by the entrance on the north over the cistern opening. Maiuri concluded there was enough soil present here to indicate this had been a garden.
