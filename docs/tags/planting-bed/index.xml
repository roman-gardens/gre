  Garden Description C. The remainder of this insula (e) had been planted and at the time of the excavation rectangular planting bed contours were evident. Tree root cavities were noted around the perimeter of each bed and four rectangular water basins (one of which was double) was recorded in the plan as well as a cistern opening. It is possible that these beds were planted with the cabbage that Pompei made famous.
