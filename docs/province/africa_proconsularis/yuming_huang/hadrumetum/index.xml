      <description>Province Africa proconsularis
Province Description The history of Roman Africa begins in 146 BC with the destruction of Carthage and the establishment of the province of Africa in the most fertile part of the Carthaginian Empire. The new province covered about 5000 square miles (17,172 square kilometers) of the northern part of modern Tunisia. A praetor governed the area from his headquarters at Utica. The Romans inherited a thriving agriculture developed by the Carthaginians. The climate was hospitable. Wheat and barley were the most important cereals; wine and olive oil were also produced and there were various fruit trees.
Location Hadrumetum (Sousse)
Hadrumetum (Pleiades)
Location Description Hadrumetum is located on the bay of Hammamet at the edge of the fertile region of Sahel from which it drew its wealth. Choosing the side of Rome against Carthage during the Punic war, Hadrumetum was rewarded with the status of free town. Taking the side of Pompey, the city was heavily fined by Caesar after his victory at Thapsus. Nevertheless, the opulence of its houses adorned with luxurious mosaics testifies that the city experienced great economic development after its elevation to the status of colony, under Trajan.
Garden House of Sorothus (Maison de Sorothus)
Keywords Garden Description This very damaged house was laid out around a peristyle garden. A semi-circular and bisected basin was placed on the axis of the reception room (Pan view, Fig. 1). The small wall that enclosed the garden was painted with flowers.
