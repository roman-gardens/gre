      <description>Province Africa proconsularis
Province Description The history of Roman Africa begins in 146 BC with the destruction of Carthage and the establishment of the province of Africa in the most fertile part of the Carthaginian Empire. The new province covered about 5000 square miles (17,172 square kilometers) of the northern part of modern Tunisia. A praetor governed the area from his headquarters at Utica. The Romans inherited a thriving agriculture developed by the Carthaginians. The climate was hospitable. Wheat and barley were the most important cereals; wine and olive oil were also produced and there were various fruit trees.
Location Althiburos (Médeïna)
Althiburos (Pleiades)
Location Description This town is located on the road between Carthage and Theveste near the border of Proconsularis and Byzacena 35 km west of Mactar. Under the Roman Empire it remained an indigenous civitas until it was raised to the status of a municipium by Hadrian: municipium aelium hadrianum augustum althiburitanum and later was granted the ius Italicum.
The trade of agricultural products and craftsmanship made Althiburos a prosperous city, particularly, the fabrication and the commerce of aromatics. The development of the city reached its peak under the Antonian and Severian dynasties. It is difficult to follow the history of Althiburos during the third century when the province of Africa underwent the severe crisis of 238. The city was abandoned just before the Arab conquest. Excavations have brought to light the forum, the capitol, the Hadrianic triumphal arch and two temples. At the east corner of the forum, near one of the temples, was a complex of houses and a building with a rotonda to the south of which stood a monumental fountain. Outside the excavated center are other monuments, among them the theater and a triumphal arch.
Garden Asclepeia Building (Edifice des Asclepeia)
Keywords Garden Description The Asklepeia monument, so-called from a mosaic inscription, is located to the northeast of the House of the Muses. (Plan view, Fig. 1)
This building is divided into three sections: the central building, the northeast sector and the private baths. The central building, probably a house, presents an architectural arrangement unusual in Africa. Strictly symmetrical in plan, the monument has a long gallery terminating at either end in two corner turrets. The facade has several windows on either side of an impressive entrance. This corridor opens onto a large square room flanked on either side by a square-shaped basin with a passageway running around it. This great vestibule views onto a peristyle garden (20.33x17.5m) equipped with a complete hydraulic system in the garden (167m2). Two large symmetrical oeci, along with their adjoining apartments, frame both sides of this peristyle. The garden gradually changed during three phases of building renovation.
During the first phase, in the beginning of the third century, the garden was bordered by twenty columns and had a well (f) and two square shaped enclosures (e, h) from which water jets came out. One jetted towards the reception room (4) located near the entrance on the south and the other jetted symmetrically towards the reception room (23) on the north.
During the second phase, in the mid third century, the garden was enclosed by a balustrade and several water features were added: two semi-circular basins (c, d) symmetrical in shape and size – with a rectangular shape on the outside and semi-circular on the inside, each facing a reception room (28, 16). A shallow round pool that had the shape of a daisy with 49 petals was placed inside the N square enclosure (h) from which water was jetting. The well was later filled with soil and not used.
During this phase, a long rectangular basin was laid in front of the entrance of the house. The basin may have been bordered by a garden.
During the third stage dated to the beginning of the second half of the fourth century, the water features were modified and a large basin was added. Niches were added inside the semi-circular basins. In the center of the garden, a rectangular basin (g) (6.20x4.20m) that protruded onto the square basin (h) and enclosed a small rectangular basin (g) (0.15x0.15m) was added.

Garden House of the Fishing Scene (Maison de la scène de pêche)
Keywords Garden Description The house stands on the other side of the Wadi Oum El Abid, on the left bank, 120 meters to the north of the capitol. The badly damaged rooms are arranged around a peristyle whose porticoes are paved with mosaics (Plan view, Fig.1). A long basin bisected the garden that was enclosed by a balustrade running in between the columns. One of the rooms to the north of the peristyle has two symmetrical apses at each end and is paved with a famous mosaic representing a fishing scene with the head of Oceanus depicted at either end. Severian period (IIIrd c.).

Garden House of the Muses (Maison des Muses)
Keywords Garden Description The house, noteworthy for its many and varied mosaic floors, is located on the right side of Oum El Abid river in a residential neighborhood. This vast domus is laid out around a peristyle onto which the rooms open. The courtyard (6.50 x 6.50 m) may have been planted (Plan view, Fig. 1). A long basin (4.15x 1.85; D. 0,72m.) was placed on the axis of the triclinium (G). Each end of the basin is curved to form a semi-circular pool.
The triclinium was bordered on two sides by two apartments that each had rooms and a corridor. The rooms to the north of the triclinium have an additional non-paved courtyard (L) enclosed by a colonnade closed by a balustrade. This lightwell may have been a small garden.
