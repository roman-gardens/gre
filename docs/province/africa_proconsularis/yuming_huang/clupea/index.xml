      <description>Province Africa proconsularis
Province Description The history of Roman Africa begins in 146 BC with the destruction of Carthage and the establishment of the province of Africa in the most fertile part of the Carthaginian Empire. The new province covered about 5000 square miles (17,172 square kilometers) of the northern part of modern Tunisia. A praetor governed the area from his headquarters at Utica. The Romans inherited a thriving agriculture developed by the Carthaginians. The climate was hospitable. Wheat and barley were the most important cereals; wine and olive oil were also produced and there were various fruit trees.
Location Aspis/Clupea (Kelibia)
Aspis/Clupea (Pleiades)
Location Description The city was built along the slope of the hill several kilometers northwest of the present town. Excavations revealed the Capitol and an important residential district descending in successive levels towards the bank.
Garden House of the Bust of Marcus Aurelius (Maison du Buste de Marc Aurèle)
Keywords Garden Description This domus (ca. 1000 m²) has a large central garden (250 m²) enclosed by a peristyle (20.20 x 21.40 m, 432.30 m²) (Plan view, Fig. 1). The northwest wing seems the most important area of the house. It had a large corridor that opened onto a portico with a view toward the garden. In the garden, along the axis of the main reception room, a semi-circular aedicula was installed on a cistern where fragments of Marcus Aurelius bust were found. On the south side of the garden was a semi-circular pool.
The wing that is perpendicular to the northwest one was comprised of a series of rooms built against the hill. All rooms were paved with mosaics and belonged to a latter phase. Rooms located on the higher level beyond this wing had a large panoramic view of the sea.

Garden House of the small Peristyle (Maison du petit péristyle)
Keywords Garden Description This small house (320 m²) is located on the lower part of the hill, south of the House of Marcus Aurelius. The plan is characteristic of small houses with a peristyle (Plan view, Fig. 1). The west part of the house is occupied by a large triclinium opening onto the peristyle. Four other rooms paved with mosaics are laid on the north aisle. Surrounding the mortared courtyard a low wall interweaves between the columns, creating a semi-circular exedra on the eastern side. Possibly belonging to this same house, on the east side there is a garden with a basin in the northern corner.

Garden House of the Two Hunts (Maison aux deux chasses)
Keywords Garden Description Known for its beautiful hunting scene mosaics, this large domus (1100m2) was laid out around a square shaped peristyle-garden (15.50x15m) (Plan view, Fig. 1, 2, 3). The low wall of four porticos enclosed the viridarium, which curves to form an apse in front of the oecus. The house was constructed on the remains of an old salt factory; the three basins located on the east side of the garden are the remains of the previous phase of the building.
