      <description>Province Gallia_narbonensis
Gallia_narbonensis (Pleiades)
Province Description Ancient Roman colony (founded 118 BCE) and senatorial province located in modern southern France, along the Mediterranean. This province had stronger cultural and political ties to Italy than the rest of Gaul.
Location Arelate
Arelate (Pleiades)
Location Description Arles was one of the pilgrimage sites on route to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. French pilgrimage routes to Compostela tend to follow old Roman roads, many of which continued to be utilized as primary roads of communication during the Middle Ages. Arles was a leading city of the west Roman Empire. It fell under Visigoth control during the 6th century and then under Muslims rule in 730. It has a Roman arena dating to the 1st century BCE, which is presently used for bullfights and plays. It also has many Roman ruins. Arles was home to Vincent van Gogh during a productive period of his career.

House House I, Quartier de la Verrerie at Trinquetaille
Keywords  mosaics (visual works) opus sectile (visual works) porticoes  House Description This house on the right bank of the Rhone is at [20] on the map. Excavations in 1982-1984, partially uncovered the remains of the building of about 240 square meters. Almost all of the fourteen known rooms of this rich house have mosaic or opus sectile floors. The house revealed by the excavations was built about 180 CE, but three prior phases, from the first and second century, were noted. It was occupied until about 260 and underwent repairs visible in restorations of the mosaics. The free space north of rooms [1], [2] and [9] was probably a garden without porticoes. How far it extended to the north and east is not known.

Keywords  domus mosaics (visual works) courtyards peristyles (Roman courtyards) porticoes  House Description This house at [14] on the map, was discovered in 1977 in an emergency salvage excavation. It was constructed about 180 and destroyed in the third quarter of the third century. The portion revealed was composed of four rooms, aligned in an east-west direction, with polychrome mosaic floors and a southern wall that was seemingly without openings. Along the north side, however, was a wide portico giving light and air to the rooms. Beyond it, there extended an area that was perhaps a garden.
