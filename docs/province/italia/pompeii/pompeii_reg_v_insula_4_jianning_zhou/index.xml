Keywords  gutters (building drainage components) cisterns (plumbing components) triclinia (couches) trellises altars (religious fixtures) lararia  Garden Description This house with an unusual design had a garden (a) in the rear southwest corner that was separated from a courtyard to the north by a low masonry wall. Between the garden wall and the wall of the house a gutter was formed which directed the roof run off into a cistern. A marble garden herm was found on the low wall with the head of a satyr sporting goat’s ears and ram’s horns (0.20 high). In the center of the garden stood a masonry triclinium (l. medius, 4.00 m.; l. imus and. summus 3.75 m.) decorated with plants painted on a yellow background, a masonry table with a colored marble top (090 x 1.50 m.) sat between the couches. Excavators reported the post holes for the pergola were reinforced with potsherds to bolster the posts. The south and west walls were lined with cavities (the dimensions were not recorded) that were centered in soil depressions to hold water. In the northwest corner of the garden a masonry altar sat in front of an arched niche.

Keywords  cubicula (domestic spaces) atrium houses predellas tablina gutters (building drainage components) trellises  Garden Description A. Immediately to the south of the rear door to the tablinium, excavated in 1900, was a very small garden (a) with a low wall on the north end. A gutter bordered the garden on the west, north and east sides. The cubiculum (c) on the south side of the atrium had garden representations on the east and west walls. These were painted in yellow on a black background on the predella under the central panels. The panel on the east wall is 0.12 x 0.80 m. and shows a rectangular garden 0.39 m. long enclosed by a lattice fence. The entrance in the middle of the front occupies approximately one third of the length of the wall and so the square area either side of the entrance and directly behind the entrance are of the same size. Vegetation is drawn along the outside of the fence in front.

Keywords  tablina peristyles (Roman courtyards) porticoes predellas lararia fountains  Garden Description B. At the rear of this house a peristyle garden (b) was bordered on the south by a portico. Three columns and an engaged column, stuccoed and fluted on the top, red at the bottom, supported the portico. A large animal painting occupied three walls of the peristyle garden with a bold checkerboard above and a black dado at the base painted with stylized plants and flowers. The west wall featured a garden representation on the predella. The garden is entered through a tall portal with a round oscillum suspended beneath a crater-shaped vase on the top of the entry. The front fence forms an excedra on either side of the entrance and shrubbery painted in green is shown along the front. Garden representations cover the entire dado (0.55 x 3.50 m.) of both the north and south walls of the tablinium. On a black background a garden is enclosed by an elaborate fence that suggests marble with a curvilinear and rectilinear design. The garden on the north wall a large semicircle in the center has a footed circular fountain with a water jet in the center, the water falling in two streams. The south wall has a crater-shaped fountain in an angular niche. Flowers bloom in lavender and white while birds sit on the fence in both paintings. A white flower garland graces the base of the paintings and traces of a schola are visible on the north wall.
