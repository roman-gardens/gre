# Article Punchlist

- Title in title case with spaces?
- Province `relref` correct?
- Location
    - folder `relref`
    - Pleiades ID
- Keywords, separated by newline (`\` at end of line)
- Sublocation `relref` present? -> comment out for now
- Pleiades ID
    - Numbers in link?
    - `"(Pleiades)"` in link? -> delete
    - Two links present, one with `relref` -> delete `relref`
- figures linked correctly?
- check all `ref`s to other gardens, should be `relref`s

# Articles in need of a second look

- achaea/corinth/corinth_circus, images with no links (image folder empty -JEM)
- ger sup/dietikon, no orcid for Christa Ebnöther
- ger sup/vallon, two map images are broken, replace with new


# Image cropping and straightening

- [x] achaea
- [x] britannia
- [x] dacia_traiana
- [x] dalmatia
- [x] germania_inferior
- [x] germania_superior
- [x] macedonia
- [x] pannonia

# Pompeii Notes/Issues

- Titles (I.ii.10). Right now if a location doesn't have a specific name, using the I.ii.10 ID.
- [x] Artifacts: TBD on how to note
- [x] Green (additions to entries?). What to do? There appears to be ORANGE now as well.
- [x] Add span style color families to new green parts of entries.
- [ ] Someone should relook over the bibs to see if they know what book the author is referring to, as I can't figure it out with just an author last name.
- [x] Image PATHs might need modifying.
- [x] Note to self: relook over entries and add [statue] keyword.
- [x] Note if it has literary evidence/artifacts.
- [x] Issue: I have found a entry that is House of Epidius Fortunatus (I.iii.3) and another that is I.iii.3. If there is a distinction, should we make it clearer?
- [x] *Aedicula lararium* added as one keyword merged from the two currently listed.
- [x] Should I include excavations dates in date section?
- [x] Province edits for keywords


# TODO 2025

- [x] merge nav-merge into master-new (which will be renamed "main" and become the default branch)
- [x] remove unused layouts
- [x] remove PROVINCE_ID from front matter - province is part of the directory structure
- [ ] move province descriptions from garden to separate files?
- [ ] recover gallia aquitania entries? https://github.com/roman-gardens/gre/commit/06b191b293c531a31dca04631b02d031a3a1b32d
- [ ] document how theme files should be edited (not in mainroad directory!)
- [ ] Bibliography first item actually two? https://roman-gardens.github.io/province/italia/rome/regio_x_palatium/domus_augustana/
- [x] move all images to separate repo? -- experiment and assess pros/cons
- [ ] alternative names -- example https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-a/id/5c8aada6d5
- [ ] standardize and document recommendations for entry titles
        - House name, or house number, or both?
        - Roman/Arabic numerals for region, insula, house (e.g. Pompeii VIII.4.30 vs VIII.iv.30)
        - ideally, don't depend on upper/lowercase for meaning
- [ ] consistent heading levels in articles (h1, h2, h3, etc.)
- [ ] add author/editor/date metadata to (top or bottom?) of article -- no need to duplicate in the markdown
    - use a partial that will use the frontmatter values and automatically add ORCID, email, etc.
    - or link to a separate person page, [like Pleiades does](https://pleiades.stoa.org/author/thomase)
- [ ] frontmatter quoting: omit, unless ambiguous
